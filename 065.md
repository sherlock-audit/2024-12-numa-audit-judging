# closeLeverageStrategy() is not allowed during vault's paused state but repayBorrow() is

## Description
It's the protocol's prerogative to take the design call whether repayment of borrows should be allowed or not when the vault is paused. The protocol could either say:
1. It's allowed because we want borrowers to be able to close their risk exposure and threat of liquidation OR
2. It's not allowed because protocols are paused in emergency situations when a high risk vulnerability has been uncovered and hence we do not want any balance changes to happen due to user transactions right now.

It's interesting to observe however that:
1. `closeLeverageStrategy()` is _not allowed_ during a paused state. It [internally calls](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L322) `vault.repayLeverage(true)` and [repayLeverage is protected](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1267) by the `whenNotPaused` modifier.
2. The regular [repayBorrow()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CErc20.sol#L104) _is allowed_ to operate even when the protocol is paused, showing the inconsistency in code implementation. The PoC section shows a test demonstrating this.

## Impact
Irrespective of whether the protocol's design decision is the first or the second, the inconsistency in the two repay functions causes either the potential loss of funds to the borrowers, or the risk of protocol exploit during the paused state.

## Proof of Concept
Add the test inside `Vault.t.sol` and see `repayBorrow()` pass even when the vault is paused:
```js
    function test_repayDuringPause() public {
        uint borrowAmount = 0.1 ether;
        deal({token: address(rEth), to: userA, give: 10000 ether});
        vm.prank(deployer);
        comptroller._setCollateralFactor(cNuma, 1 ether);
        
        // First approve and enter the NUMA market
        vm.startPrank(userA);
        address[] memory t = new address[](1);
        t[0] = address(cNuma);
        comptroller.enterMarkets(t);

        // Buy some NUMA
        rEth.approve(address(vault), 10 ether);
        uint numas = vault.buy(10 ether, 0, userA);

        // Deposit enough NUMA as collateral
        numa.approve(address(cNuma), numas);
        cNuma.mint(numas);

        // Borrow rEth
        uint balanceBefore = rEth.balanceOf(userA);
        cReth.borrow(borrowAmount);
        assertEq(rEth.balanceOf(userA) - balanceBefore, borrowAmount, "Borrow failed");

        // Get current borrow balance 
        uint borrowBalance = cReth.borrowBalanceCurrent(userA);
        assertGt(borrowBalance, 0, "No borrow balance");
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Pause the vault
        vm.prank(deployer);
        vault.pause();

        // Try to repay while paused
        vm.startPrank(userA);
        rEth.approve(address(cReth), borrowBalance);
        cReth.repayBorrow(borrowBalance);  // <----------------- @audit : does not revert !

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Mitigation
Either both functions' call shouldn't be allowed, or both should be.

## Note
It might be the case that `closeLeverageStrategy()` should perhaps be allowed even in paused state as per the [following comment](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/ComptrollerStorage.sol#L76) present inside `ComptrollerStorage.sol`:
> Actions which allow users to remove their own assets cannot be paused.
