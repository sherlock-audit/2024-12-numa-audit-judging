# Synthetics Value is Lack Of Validation

### Summary

Synthetics value could be bigger than vault dollar value because lack of validation after synth asset minted.

### Root Cause

README :

> Vault dollar value should always exceed dollar value of outstanding synthetics

Based on above statement, the vault dollar value should always exceed dollar worth of synthetics whatever the condition is. However there is no validation to checks this requirement after user mints the synthetics.

When user try to mint new synthetics by calling `NumaPrinter::mintNuAsset`, there is a modifier validation where it checks if the collateral factor belows the cf_warning, but the checks was before the synthetics minted. There is no checks to validate the vault dollar value should always exceed dollar value of outstanding synthetic after the new synthetics being minted.

Assuming the protocol state :

1. Eth balance of all vault = 18e18
2. Synth value in ETH = 10e18
3. Collateral Factor = 1800

This state will bypass the validation in `notInWarningCF` modifier which will continue the function to mint new synthetics for the recipient. Malicious recipient could then mint synth asset by calling `NumaPrinter::mintAssetOutputFromNuma` and specify the `_nuAssetamount` with 9e18 ETH worth of Synth. At the end, the collateral factor will be `947` (18e18 : 19e18) where synth value in ETH is bigger. This condition is easily reached moreover because of the Numa token being traded in DEX.

```solidity
    function mintNuAsset(INuAsset _asset, address _recipient, uint _amount, uint _numaAmount) internal notInWarningCF {
        // uint currentCF = vaultManager.getGlobalCF();
        // require(currentCF > vaultManager.getWarningCF(), "minting forbidden");

        // mint
        _asset.mint(_recipient, _amount);
        vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
        emit AssetMint(address(_asset), _amount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

```diff
    function mintNuAsset(INuAsset _asset, address _recipient, uint _amount, uint _numaAmount) internal {
        // uint currentCF = vaultManager.getGlobalCF();
        // require(currentCF > vaultManager.getWarningCF(), "minting forbidden");

        // mint
        _asset.mint(_recipient, _amount);
        vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
+       uint currentCF = vaultManager.getGlobalCF();
+       if (currentCF < 1000) revert();
        emit AssetMint(address(_asset), _amount);
    }
