# BorrowRateMaxMantissa isn`t specific to the chain protocol is being deployed to

### Summary

The point of borrowRateMaxMantissa is to put the protocol in failure mode when utilisation makes borrowrate absurd however It is defined as a constant for all the chains and it should really be changed according to average blocktime of the different chains the protocol is being deployed to.

### Root Cause

`uint internal constant borrowRateMaxMantissa = 0.0005e16;` -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CTokenInterfaces.sol#L31
 `require(
            borrowRateMantissa <= borrowRateMaxMantissa,
            "borrow rate is absurdly high"
        );`-
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L442-L445
the protocol is being deployed to 3 chains Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum - 
assuming the default blocks of each chain here is the calculations for maximum borrow rate- 
`Ethereum 12s blocks`
Blocks per year = (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) / 12 = 2,628,000
Max  = 0.0005e16 * 2,628,000
= 131.4%

`Base 2s blocks:`

Blocks per year = (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) / 2 = 15,768,000
Max  = 0.0005e16 * 15,768,000
= 788.4%

`Arbitrum (Variable blocks):`

Average block time = 0.25s to 2s
Blocks per year (at 1s) = (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) = 31,536,000
Max = 0.0005e16 * 31,536,000
= 1576.8%

### Impact
config value mismatch - 
Users on faster chains (Base, Arbitrum) are forced to pay significantly higher maximum interest rates (788.4% and 1576.8% APR) compared to Ethereum users (131.4% APR) for the same utilization levels, creating unfair borrowing conditions across chain deployments.
