# Excessive Buy PID Adjustment Due to Double Fee Application in `buyNoMax`

### Summary

The `buyNoMax` function when calling the function `vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(numaAmount, true);` does includes fees. This inadvertently inflates the calculation of the buy PID adjustment (buyPID_adj) by applying fees twice in vault manager contract . This is because the numaAmount passed to updateBuyFeePID already includes fees and The `numaToEth` function further inflates the price by dividing by the buy fee, As shown beow 
```solidity
    function updateBuyFeePID(uint _numaAmount, bool _isVaultBuy) external {
        if (_numaAmount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint currentBlockts = block.timestamp;
        if (nextCheckBlock == 0) {
            nextCheckBlock = currentBlockts + nextCheckBlockWindowDelta;
        }
        // when delta time is reached or PID is below last reference we reset reference
        else if (currentBlockts > nextCheckBlock) {
            //reset the increment max rate params
            buyPIDXhrAgo = buy_fee_PID;
            //set new block height +xhrs from now
            nextCheckBlock = currentBlockts + nextCheckBlockWindowDelta;
        }

        if (address(printer) == address(0x0)) {
            buy_fee_PID = 0;
        } else {
            require(
                isVault(msg.sender) || (msg.sender == address(printer)),
                "only vault&printer"
            );
            uint _priceTWAP = printer.getTWAPPriceInEth(1 ether, twapPID);
            uint _vaultBuyPrice = numaToEth(1 ether, PriceType.BuyPrice);

            // we use amount in Eth
 >>>           uint ethAmount = (_numaAmount * _vaultBuyPrice) / (1 ether);

            uint pctFromBuyPrice;
            if (_priceTWAP < _vaultBuyPrice) {
                //percentage down from buyPrice  in base 1000
                pctFromBuyPrice = 1000 - (1000 * _priceTWAP) / _vaultBuyPrice;
            }

            if ((pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy) {
                //_price is within incTriggerPct% of buyPrice, and is a vault buy
                uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_incAmt) / (1 ether);
```
Also in the `numaToEth(` price is already applied here, 
```soildity
    function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken(
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
  >>          result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee();
        } else if (_t == PriceType.SellPrice) {
            (uint sellfee, , ) = getSellFeeScaling();
            result = (result * sellfee) / 1 ether;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
This results in a higher-than-expected adjustment, impacting the pricing mechanism.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L527

The numaAmount passed to updateBuyFeePID already includes fees.
The numaToEth function further inflates the ETH conversion by dividing by the buy fee.
This leads to an inflated ethAmount, causing buyPID_adj to be larger than intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

The buyNoMax function is executed with valid inputs.
numaAmount includes the buy fee.

### External pre-conditions

The VaultManager and numaToEth functions are operational and correctly integrated.

### Attack Path

- Call buyNoMax with a specific amount of LST.
- Observe that updateBuyFeePID is called with an inflated numaAmount.
- Note the excessive increase in buyPID_adj due to compounded fee application.

### Impact

The buy PID (buyPID_adj) is adjusted more than expected causing inflated buy PID adjustment.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

pass in numaAmount without BUY fee in    vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(numaAmount, true);
