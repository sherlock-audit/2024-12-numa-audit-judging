# DepositFromVault call can be bypassed on reward contracts

### Summary

In `extractInternal` function in `NumaVault` contract, if `isRwdReceiver` is true, it means that `rwd_address` is a contract, and the return value of the raw external call should be checked to ensure that the external call succeeded. Otherwise, an attacker could use gas griefing to bypass the external call, which would break the accounting. If `rwd_address` is a staking contract, the `DepositFromVault` function will not be called.


### Root Cause

The return value of the raw call made to trigger the `DepositFromVault()` function on the `rwd_address` is not checked to ensure the call was successful. This introduces a vulnerability where an attacker could bypass the external call through gas griefing. By carefully calculating the gas provided to the transaction, the attacker can ensure that the gas is only sufficient up until the raw call, causing it to fail.

Since the return value of the external call is not verified, the transaction will not revert even if the external call fails. This could lead to a situation where rewards are not deposited as intended into the staking contract.

```solidity
    function extractInternal(
        uint rwd,
        uint currentvalueWei,
        uint rwdDebt
    ) internal {
        last_extracttimestamp = block.timestamp;
        last_lsttokenvalueWei = currentvalueWei;

        rewardsFromDebt += rwdDebt;
        if (rwd_address != address(0)) {
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(lstToken), rwd_address, rwd);
            if (isContract(rwd_address) && isRwdReceiver) {
                // we don't check result as contract might not implement the deposit function (if multi sig for example)
                rwd_address.call(
                    abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", rwd)
                );
            }
        }
        emit RewardsExtracted(rwd, currentvalueWei);
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Let's say 24 hours have passed since the last reward extraction, and the reward threshold has been reached, allowing rewards to be extracted.
2. The attacker calls `updateVault` to extract the rewards but carefully calculates the gas in such a way that the external raw call to `reward_address` will fail due to insufficient gas.
3. However, since the return value of the external call is not checked, the transaction will succeed without reverting, but the rewards will not be properly accounted for in the `rwd_address` contract.




### Impact

Rewards will not be deposited into the staking contract as intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the return value of the external raw call if `isRwdReceiver` is true.
