# `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma()` has the if condition wrong, which leads to several things

### Summary

`getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma()` takes numa and converts it to eth amount via two places - LP and vault.

Given the two values, it will choose the one that converted less ETH for the numa that was inputted.

This will result in the user getting less ETH for the numa he has inputted due to the [if condition choosing the smaller value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L367)

### Root Cause

The root cause is the if condition chooses the smaller ETH value, and it should be the opposite.

We should get the most ETH we can get for the amount of Numa we input.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users have 100 `Numa` tokens and wants to burn them for `$nuBTC` via `mintAssetFromNumaInput()`
2. User is always going to overpay due to the if condition in `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma()`

### Impact

Users are always going to overpay when they want to get `nuAsset` via `Numa`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Invert the if condition, so that user doesn't get less `nuAsset` or waste money unnecessarily on gas fees due to the slippage check.
