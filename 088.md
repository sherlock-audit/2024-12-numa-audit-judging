# incorrect slippage calculation

### Summary

Incorrect slippage calculation leading to errors

### Root Cause

The slippage variable is set to 10000, with the comment // 1e4/1e18, suggesting it's intended to represent a percentage or a fraction.

In the getAmountIn function, slippage is calculated as:
amountIn = amountIn + (amountIn * slippage) / 1 ether;

However, dividing by 1 ether (which is 1e18) with slippage = 10000 results in a negligible addition due to integer division truncation. Essentially, (amountIn * 10000) / 1e18 rounds down to zero for practical values of amountIn.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let's assume amountIn = 1e18 (representing 1 token with 18 decimals).

Calculating the slippage addition:
(1e18 * 10000) / 1e18 = 10000
The slippage added is 10000, which is negligible compared to 1e18.

If slippage is intended to be a percentage, say 1%, the calculation should yield 1e16 (which is 1% of 1e18), not 10000

### Impact

The slippage addition is effectively zero, so the function does not account for slippage in some cases.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If slippage is intended to represent basis points (where 1 basis point = 0.01%), you should set slippage in terms of basis points and adjust the calculation:
uint256 slippage = 100; // Represents 1% slippage in basis points
amountIn = amountIn + (amountIn * slippage) / 10000;

OR
uint256 slippage = 100; // Represents 1% slippage in basis points

// In getAmountIn function:
amountIn = amountIn + (amountIn * slippage) / 10000;
