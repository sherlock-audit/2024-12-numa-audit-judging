# Unbounded Rewards Extraction in NumaVault

### Summary

The missing cap on rewards in `NumaVault.sol` will cause a complete depletion of the vault’s liquidity for all users as an attacker will exploit inflated oracle prices to extract excessive rewards.

### Root Cause

In NumaVault.sol:336, the rwd value calculated in the `rewardsValue` function is not capped to the vault’s available balance. This allows the rewards transferred to `rwd_address` in extractInternal to exceed the vault’s liquidity, leading to its complete depletion.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L336
- No check ensures that rwd is less than or equal to the vault’s available balance.

NumaVault.sol:360:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L360
- Transfers the entire `rwd` without verifying liquidity sufficiency.


### Internal pre-conditions

1-The last_lsttokenvalueWei is set to a value significantly lower than the current oracle price (currentvalueWei), creating a large diff in price.
2-The rwd_threshold is set to a value smaller than the calculated rwd.
3-The vault contains sufficient lstToken liquidity to execute the initial transfer.


### External pre-conditions

1-The oracle used by NumaVault needs to provide a significantly higher price for `lstToken` than the last recorded value (last_lsttokenvalueWei).
(Example: Oracle price goes from 1e18 to 1000e18 within 24 hours.)

2-The attacker controls or influences `rwd_address`.

### Attack Path

The attacker manipulates the price returned by the oracle to inflate the value of `lstToken` (e.g., by flash loaning large amounts of collateral or exploiting oracle design weaknesses).

Then trigger Reward Extraction:
- Wait until 24 hours have elapsed (satisfying the time condition in `extractRewardsNoRequire`).
- Call a function that triggers `extractRewardsNoRequire` (e.g., buy or sell).

Then extract Excessive Rewards:
- The` rwd` is calculated using the inflated oracle price, resulting in a disproportionately large reward value.
- The SafeERC20.safeTransfer call sends this unbounded reward amount to `rwd_address`, depleting the vault’s lstToken liquidity.

### Impact

Affected Party: All users of the NumaVault.

Loss: The vault’s lstToken balance is fully depleted, causing:
- 1.Failure of buy, sell, and liquidation functions due to lack of liquidity.
- 2.Potential insolvency of the protocol, as user funds cannot be redeemed.

        uint256 vaultBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(vault));

        console.log("Attacker Balance:", attackerBalance);
        console.log("Vault Balance:", vaultBalance);

        assertEq(attackerBalance, 1_000e18);
        assertEq(vaultBalance, 0);
    }
}

```
Vault holds 1,000 LST tokens; oracle price is 1e18.

- After Exploit: Attacker drains all 1,000 LST tokens from the vault. Vault balance is 0.

### Mitigation

- Cap Rewards to Available Liquidity:
Ensure that the rwd value cannot exceed the vault’s balance:

```solidity

uint256 availableBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(this));
rwd = rwd > availableBalance ? availableBalance : rwd;

```
- Add this check in extractInternal.
