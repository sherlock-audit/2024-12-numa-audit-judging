# Loss of fees to the protocol and the destablization of the protocol because the wrong indicator was used in updating the buy fee

### Root Cause

When a user burns NuAsset in exchange for $NUMA, $NUMA is minted to the user. This action impacts the buy fee, which is subsequently updated within the [`NumaPrinter::burnNuAssetFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L198C1-L208C6) function.

```solidity
    function burnNuAssetFrom(
        INuAsset _asset,
        address _sender,
        uint _amount,
        uint _numaAmount
    ) internal {
        // burn
        _asset.burnFrom(_sender, _amount);
        vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
        emit AssetBurn(address(_asset), _amount);
    }
  ```
The update to the buy fee PID is heavily influenced by whether $NUMA is being minted or burned, as determined by the `isVaultBuy` variable in the `VaultManager::updateBuyFeePID()` function. The NUMA protocol relies on arbitrage to stabilize and align prices between the vault and the LP. Consequently, the process of updating the buy fee PID takes into account the price disparity between the LP and the vault, as well as the nature of the operation (buying or selling).

When $NUMA or synthetics are minted or burned, it either widens the price disparity, creating additional arbitrage opportunities or reduces it by adjusting the fees. For instance, when users burn synthetics, they effectively mint $NUMA, increasing the vault price. This action can result in further over-collateralization and an elevated vault price. To counteract this, the buy fee is increased to discourage further $NUMA minting. This adjustment incentivizes users to purchase from the LP and sell to the vault, gradually aligning the LP price with the vault price.

For the mechanism to function effectively, the correct indicators must trigger the appropriate reactions in every scenario. However, this is not the case in the `burnNuAssetFrom()` function. When synthetics are burned, $NUMA is minted, which constitutes a buy operation. Instead of passing `true` to indicate a vault buy, `false` is mistakenly passed.

```solidity
vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
```

### Impact

Due to the use of an incorrect indicator, the buy fee PID is reduced instead of raised. A lower PID results in a reduced buy fee, which in turn leads to a loss of fees to the protocol. Fees are a critical mechanism the protocol employs to maintain over-collateralization, which is essential for preserving the value of $NUMA.

The buy fee is a key factor that must be deducted when minting $ NUMA. If the fee is calculated incorrectly, users can mint more $NUMA.

### Mitigation

Change the false in `NumaPrinter::burnNuAssetFrom()` to true for the right fee to be calculated.
