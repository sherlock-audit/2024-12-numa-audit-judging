# `minNumaPriceEth` value is too small and would cause unexpected behaviors when under collateralized

### Summary

In `VaultManager`, there is this `minNumaPriceEth` variable serving as the minimum price in case of under collateralization. The CR is determined by all vault's ETH value and synthetic assets value in ETH. When CR drops below certain value, `minNumaPriceEth` will be used as price instead of actual price. However, this current value of `minNumaPriceEth` is too low, and may break protocol's economics potentially in case of under collateralization.

### Root Cause

`minNumaPriceEth` is used in [`numaToToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L694) and [`tokenToNuma`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L640), in case of under collateralization. For example, when selling Numa for lstTokens, `numaToToken` will be called to determine output lstToken amount. Similar for buying Numa token, which `tokenToNuma` will be used.

Here are when `minNumaPriceEth` is used in both functions:
```solidity
        // tokenToNuma
        uint256 EthValue = FullMath.mulDiv(
            _refValueWei,
            _inputAmount,
            _decimals
        );

        uint synthValueInEth = getTotalSynthValueEth();
        synthValueInEth = (synthValueInEth * _synthScaling) / BASE_1000;
        uint circulatingNuma = getNumaSupply();

        uint result;
        if (EthBalance <= synthValueInEth) {
            // extreme case use minim numa price in Eth
            result = FullMath.mulDiv(
                EthValue,
                1 ether, // 1 ether because numa has 18 decimals
                minNumaPriceEth
            );
        } 
```

and:
```solidity
        // numaToToken
        uint EthBalance = getTotalBalanceEth();
        require(EthBalance > 0, "empty vaults");

        uint synthValueInEth = getTotalSynthValueEth();

        synthValueInEth = (synthValueInEth * _synthScaling) / BASE_1000;

        uint circulatingNuma = getNumaSupply();

        require(circulatingNuma > 0, "no numa in circulation");

        uint result;
        if (EthBalance <= synthValueInEth) {
            result = FullMath.mulDiv(
                FullMath.mulDiv(
                    _inputAmount,
                    minNumaPriceEth,
                    1 ether // 1 ether because numa has 18 decimals
                ),
                _decimals,
                _refValueWei
            );
        }
```

Value of `minNumaPriceEth` is `0.0000000000001 ether`, which equals to 1e5. When synthetic value is more than ETH value, buying of 1 ETH value would output 1e18 * 1e18 / 1e5 = 1e(36-5) = 1e31 numa tokens. And similarly, when selling 1e12 Numa, it would output 1e12 * 1e5 / 1e18 = 0 due to rounding.

From synthetic scale factor calculation, when the protocol is extremely under collateralized, which means the CR is below `cf_critical`:
```solidity
        if (currentCF < cf_critical) {
            // scale such that currentCF = cf_critical
            uint criticalDebaseFactor = (currentCF * BASE_1000) / cf_critical;

            // when reaching CF_CRITICAL, we use that criticalDebaseFactor in numa price so that numa price is clipped by this lower limit
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee = criticalDebaseFactor;

            // we apply this multiplier on the factor for when it's used on synthetics burning price
            criticalDebaseFactor =
                (criticalDebaseFactor * BASE_1000) /
                criticalDebaseMult;

            // for burning price we take the min between PID and criticalDebaseFactor

            if (criticalDebaseFactor < scaleSynthBurn)
                scaleSynthBurn = criticalDebaseFactor;
        }
        return (
            scaleSynthBurn,
            syntheticsCurrentPID,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee,
            blockTime
        );
```
And if synthetic value is still greater than ETH value even after this factor is applied, the scenario described above would still happen. When the collateral ratio is recovered back to normal, some users who bought NUMA during under-collaterliazed state would hold way more Numa than other users.

For example, based on [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/numa), the current price of Numa is 0.386 USD, while one ETH is about 3380 USD. If an user buys Numa with 1 ETH worth of lstToken, which is rETH, he would get 1e31 wei (1e13) Numa, and approximately 3860000000000 worth of USD. Breaking the economics of Numa to an extreme.

The following derivation shows at 104.8% collateral ratio, the scenario is possible to happen:
```text
CF = ethValue / synValue
cf_critical = 1100, ethValue = 1.1 synValue
assume target cf = x, synValue = x * ethValue
factor = x / 1.1
after scaling synValue: synValue * x / 1.1 > ethValue
but synValue = x * ethValue
x^2 / 1.1 > 1, x^2 > 1.1, x = 1.048
```

### Internal pre-conditions

The protocol is under collateralized, even after synthetic scaling, the value of synthetic assets are greater than ETH value.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

User exchanges 1e18 lstToken(rETH) for Numa, due to the usage of `minNumaPriceEth`, it would give user 1e31 wei of Numa tokens. After collateral ratio stabilizes, user can once again sell all those Numa either on other markets or the vaults.

### Impact

The economics of Numa can be broken due to huge amount minted to user during under collateralized period.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust `minNumaPriceEth` to a more proper value, for example, 1e12. Also considering disable buying and selling when under collateralized or CR is below cf_critical.
