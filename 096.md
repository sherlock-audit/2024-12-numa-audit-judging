# Reentrancy in closeLeverageStrategy() can manipulate the cNumaToken exchange rate

### Summary

Reentrancy in [`closeLeverageStrategy()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L263) can be used to steal a large number of funds from the vault. 

### Root Cause

In `closeLeverageStrategy()`, the `_collateral` token parameter is not enforced to be `cNuma` or `cLst` , allowing a maliciously crafted contract to be passed in. 

Flashloan repayment can be avoided by re-entering and calling `closeLeverageStrategy()` with a tiny amount, which updates `leverageDebt` to a small value.

### Impact

There are many ways to exploit this to steal vault funds.

**One way:**

When we bypass the flash loan as explained in 'Root Cause', we force the underlying tokens to be transferred to the cToken. This increases the return value of `getCashPrior()` which increases the exchange rate.

We can use a flash loan to mint cTokens -> do the exploit (which increases exchange rate) -> then redeem underlying tokens, effectively stealing the flash borrowed funds from the vault.
