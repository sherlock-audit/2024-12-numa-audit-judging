# No RWAs have a chainlink feed in ETH, so RWAs cannot be minted as nuAssets

### Summary

A key intention of the protocol is to allow RWAs with chainlink feeds to be represented with synthetic nuAssets.

The issue is that the protocol only works with chainlink feeds where the asset is priced with ETH.

All the RWAs like gold, oil, etc on chainlink are only available with USD pairs, not ETH.

### Root Cause

The protocol only works with chainlink feeds where the asset is priced with ETH, but all the RWAs like gold, crude oil, etc on chainlink are only available with USD pairs, not ETH.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Impact

Protocol in it's current form cannot work with RWAs. 

### PoC

### Mitigation

Have a way to convert the ASSET/USD pairs into ASSET/ETH using the ETH/USD price feed.
