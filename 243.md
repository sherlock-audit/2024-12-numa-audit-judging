# Incorrect Token Conversion Due to Misapplied Fee in Asset Swap

### Summary

The `getNbOfnuAssetNeededForNuma` function in the NumaPrinter contract inaccurately calculates the ETH equivalent of Numa tokens due to a decreased sell fee applied in the numaToEth function of the VaultManager contract.  T

### Root Cause

The numaToEth function in the VaultManager contract decreases the ETH amount by applying a sell fee, leading to an inaccurate ETH equivalent for the Numa tokens.
```solidity
function numaToEth(
    uint _inputAmount,
    PriceType _t
) public view returns (uint256) {
    (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
    uint result = tokenToNuma(
        _inputAmount,
        1 ether,
        1 ether,
        criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
    );
    if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
        result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee();
    } else if (_t == PriceType.SellPrice) {
>>        (uint sellfee, , ) = getSellFeeScaling();
        result = (result * sellfee) / 1 ether;
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

numaToEth is called with PriceType.SellPrice.
Sell fee is applied within numaToEth function in VaultManager.

### External pre-conditions

getNbOfnuAssetNeededForNuma is called to determine nuAsset requirements.
VaultManager is integrated with NumaPrinter.

### Attack Path

User calls getNbOfnuAssetNeededForNuma.
numaToEth decreases ETH value due to sell fee.

### Impact

System will default to pool price even when vault is more favourabe

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 ethAmountVault = vaultManager.numaToEth(
    amountWithFee,
+   IVaultManager.PriceType.BuyPrice
);
```
