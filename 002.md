# Protocol fetch incorrect `block.number` on Arbitrum

### Summary

`CNumaLst` and `CNumaToken` relies on both `block.number` and `block.timestamp` to accure interest. However arbitrum `block.number` will return a value close to (but not necessarily exactly) the L1 block number at which the sequencer received the transaction. This allows malicious users to minimize interest through specific strategies, thereby reducing the returns for suppliers.

### Root Cause

The root cause is [`CToken.sol:L242`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L241C1-L243C6)
```solidity
    function getBlockNumber() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        return block.number;
    }
```
According to [Arbitrum doc](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time#ethereum-block-numbers-within-arbitrum),
> Accessing block numbers within an Arbitrum smart contract (i.e., block.number in Solidity) will return a value close to (but not necessarily exactly) the L1 block number at which the sequencer received the transaction.

Compared to the L1 block time, which is 12 seconds, the L2 block time on Arbitrum is only about 0.25 seconds. Since orders on Arbitrum usually decay within a few seconds (less than 8 seconds at the time of writing), it would be necessary to calculate blockDelta based on L2 block numbers to allow the orders to decay as expected and enable more flexible configurations of the decay curve.

This can lead to inaccuracies in `accureInterest()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol to be deployed on Arbitrum. This is confirmed by contest Readme.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Breaks some core functions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before deploying to Arbitrum, change
```solidity
    function getBlockNumber() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        return block.number;
    }
```
to
```solidity
    function getBlockNumber() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        return ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber() // returns Arbitrum block number;
    }
```
