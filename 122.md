# Fee Address Not Set in Constructor Leads to Loss of Fees

### Summary

In the NumaVault.sol contract, the feeAddress variable is not initialized in the constructor. This results in all fees that should have been collected being directed to an unset (likely zero) address. As a consequence, fees are lost permanently and cannot be recovered, impacting the intended beneficiaries of these fees.

### Root Cause

```javascript
 constructor(
        address _numaAddress,
        address _tokenAddress,
        uint256 _decimals,
        address _oracleAddress,
        address _minterAddress,
        uint _existingDebt, // in case of migration
        uint _existingRwdFromDebt // in case of migration
    ) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        minterContract = NumaMinter(_minterAddress);
        numa = NUMA(_numaAddress);
        oracle = IVaultOracleSingle(_oracleAddress);
        lstToken = IERC20(_tokenAddress);
        decimals = _decimals;

        // lst rewards
        last_extracttimestamp = block.timestamp;
        last_lsttokenvalueWei = oracle.getTokenPrice(decimals);

        // debt for migration
        debt = _existingDebt;
        rewardsFromDebt = _existingRwdFromDebt;
        // paused by default because might be empty
        _pause();
    }
```
Here in the constructor the fee address is not initialized in the Vault 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Any fees generated by the Vault contract operations are sent to the zero address instead of the intended recipient, leading to irreversible loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set fee address in the constructor
