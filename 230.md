# Exchange Rate Manipulation Through Reserve Withdrawal

### Summary

the exchange rate calculation includes reserves, allowing malicious users to profit through sandwich attacks around reserve withdrawals by the admin

### Root Cause

The exchange rate calculation in CToken.sol:
`uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) / _totalSupply;`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L393-L401
and when admin withdraw reserves:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L1503-L1542
when owner will call _reduceReserves the exchange rate will increase due to this the numerator will also increase this will increase the exchange rate. which can be exploited by malicious user to make profit by watching the mempool


### Internal pre-conditions

admin calls the `function _reduceReservesFresh` 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Monitor mempool for _reduceReserves
Front-run with deposit
Wait for reserve withdrawal
Back-run with withdrawal at higher exchange rate
Detailed Math Example:
Initial State:
totalCash = 100,000
totalBorrows = 50,000
totalSupply = 150,000
reserves = 10,000
expScale = 1e18
Initial Exchange Rate = ((100,000 + 50,000 - 10,000) * 1e18) / 150,000
= (140,000 * 1e18) / 150,000
= 0.933e18
After Admin Withdraws 8,000 Reserves:
totalCash = 100,000
totalBorrows = 50,000
totalSupply = 150,000
reserves = 2,000
New Exchange Rate = ((100,000 + 50,000 - 2,000) * 1e18) / 150,000
= (148,000 * 1e18) / 150,000
= 0.987e18
Exchange rate increases by ~5.7%, creating profit opportunity through sandwich `attack.

### Impact

Malicious users can extract value through sandwich attacks by front-running when admin withdraws reserves, as the exchange rate increases immediately after reserve reduction. attackers can front-run with deposits and back-run with withdrawals to profit from the artificially inflated exchange rate (e.g., 0.933 to 0.987 in the example above), creating a risk-free profit opportunity
