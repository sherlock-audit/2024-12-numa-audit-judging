# Owner-Centralized Withdrawals in withdrawToken

### Summary

The unrestricted withdrawal capability in NumaVault will cause a complete loss of funds for all users as a malicious or compromised owner will call withdrawToken to transfer all assets from the vault.

### Root Cause

In NumaVault.sol:1305, the withdrawToken function allows the owner to transfer any ERC20 token from the vault to any address without restrictions. This function lacks safeguards, such as governance approval, multi-signature requirements, or withdrawal limits.

Relevant Code:
NumaVault.sol:1305:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1305

### Internal pre-conditions

1-The owner role is controlled by a single private key or account.
2-The` withdrawToken` function is callable without time-locks or additional approvals.

### External pre-conditions

1-The owner account is compromised (e.g., via phishing or key leakage).
2-The protocol relies on centralized control for sensitive operations.

### Attack Path

-An attacker gains access to the ownerâ€™s private key (e.g., through phishing or malware).
-The attacker calls` withdrawToken` repeatedly, transferring all ERC20 tokens from the vault to their own address:
`vault.withdrawToken(address(lstToken), vaultBalance, attackerAddress);`

Complete Vault Depletion:
- All user funds held in the vault are drained, leaving it with a zero balance.

### Impact

Affected Party: The protocol and all users.
Loss: Complete loss of user funds stored in the vault, totaling all ERC20 tokens under its custody.
- Gain: The attacker acquires all vault assets.

    function setUp() public {
        // Deploy mock dependencies
        lstToken = new MockToken("LST Token", "LST", 18);
        vault = new NumaVault(
            address(lstToken),
            address(lstToken),
            18,
            address(0x0), // No oracle for this test
            address(this),
            0,
            0
        );

        // Fund the vault
        lstToken.mint(address(vault), 1_000e18);
    }

    function testOwnerWithdrawalExploit() public {
        // Simulate attacker gaining control of owner account
        vm.startPrank(attacker);

        // Execute withdrawal
        uint256 vaultBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(vault));
        vault.withdrawToken(address(lstToken), vaultBalance, attacker);

        // Assert vault is drained
        uint256 attackerBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 remainingVaultBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(vault));

        console.log("Attacker Balance:", attackerBalance);
        console.log("Vault Balance:", remainingVaultBalance);

        assertEq(attackerBalance, 1_000e18);
        assertEq(remainingVaultBalance, 0);
    }
}

```
Vault holds 1,000 LST tokens; attacker balance is 0.
- After Exploit: The attacker drains all 1,000 LST tokens from the vault using withdrawToken. Vault balance is 0.


### Mitigation

1-Governance-Based Withdrawals:
- Replace onlyOwner with a governance-based approval mechanism for withdrawal operations:
```solidity

modifier onlyGovernance {
    require(msg.sender == governance, "Not authorized");
    _;
}
```
2-Multi-Signature Requirements:
- Require multi-signature approval for critical operations like withdrawals to prevent single-point compromise.

3-Withdrawal Time-Lock:
- Introduce a time-lock for withdrawals, providing users with a window to respond to potential threats:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public withdrawalRequests;
uint256 public constant WITHDRAWAL_DELAY = 48 hours;


function requestWithdrawal(address _token, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner {
    withdrawalRequests[_token] = block.timestamp + WITHDRAWAL_DELAY;
}

function executeWithdrawal(address _token, uint256 _amount, address _receiver) external onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp >= withdrawalRequests[_token], "Withdrawal delay not met");
    SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(_token), _receiver, _amount);
}
```
4-Withdraw Limits:
 Implement limits on the amount that can be withdrawn in a single transaction.
