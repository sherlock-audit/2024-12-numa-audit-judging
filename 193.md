# Using the last LST price during Numa minting results in minting fewer tokens than intended

### Summary

While minting Numa, the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is used to determine the value of the LST tokens provided by the user. This can result in the user's provided LST being undervalued, causing the user to receive fewer Numa tokens than the actual value of the LST tokens they provided.

### Root Cause

Using the last LST price during minting Numa in NumaVault can result in users minting fewer Numa tokens (or sometimes more if the LST is slashed). This happens because the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is only updated every 24 hours when rewards are extracted. Users minting Numa close to the next update will likely receive fewer Numa tokens. Additionally, there are cases where the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` will not be updated if the reward threshold is not met, and rewards are not extracted.  


```solidity
function buyNoMax(
        uint _inputAmount,
        uint _minNumaAmount,
        address _receiver,
        uint _criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee,
        bool _transferREth
    ) internal nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint _numaOut) {
        // SAME CODE AS buy() but no max amount (used for liquidations)
        // buys can be paused if we want to force people to buy from other vaults
        require(!buyPaused, "buy paused");
        require(_inputAmount > MIN, "must trade over min");

        // execute buy
        uint256 numaAmount = vaultManager.tokenToNuma(
            _inputAmount,
            last_lsttokenvalueWei, // @audit should use new lst price here
            decimals,
            _criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee   
        );
        
        // ...
        
}

### Attack Path

1. Let's say the last LST (Liquid Staking Token) price is 1 rETH = 1.001 ETH.  
2. Rewards were extracted 22 hours ago, so the last LST price is 22 hours old.  
3. The current LST price is 1 rETH = 1.002 ETH.  
4. Let's assume 1 Numa = 0.0001 ETH.  
5. A user minted Numa using 10 rETH. Based on the last LST price, the calculation for Numa would be:  
   (10 * 1.001) / 0.0001 = 100,100 Numa.  
6. However, based on the current LST price, the calculation for Numa should be:  
   (10 * 1.002) / 0.0001 = 100,200 Numa.  
7. The user received 100 Numa less than the amount they would have gotten if the current LST price had been used.  

This discrepancy arises because the last LST price (22 hours old) was used instead of the current price, leading to a 100 Numa loss for the user.  


### Impact

The user will get less Numa than the provided value during Numa minting

### Mitigation

Use latest lst price while minting Numa instead of using `last_lsttokenvalueWei` price
