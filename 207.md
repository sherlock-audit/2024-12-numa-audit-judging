# `VaultManager.numaToEth` hardcoded 1:1 price of rETH-ETH

### Summary

## Description
In `VaultManager.sol` the `numaToToken` method is used to determine how many lst tokens can be derived from numa amount. The second input in the function is `refValueWei` which is the last recorded price of rETH in ETH. All instances where `numaToToken` is called, the second input is `last_lsttokenvalueWei` which is a snapshot of the last recorded call to the oracle of the lst. However in `VaultManager.numaToEth`, the lst price in wei is hardcoded to `1 ether` 
```solidity
    function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken(
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether, // @audit-issue this value is supposed to be rETH/ETH price
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
    }
```
This assumption is entirely wrong as we can see from [the price chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth/eth) that RETH has steadily been at least 10% more expensive than ETH. Numa pricing and conversions will always be wrong, creating opportunities to profit on the back of the Numa protocol. 

### Root Cause

- In [`VaultManager.numaToEth`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L764-L768) invokes `numaToToken` with hardcoded reference price RETH/ETH = 1

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, wrong logic

### Impact

- broken core functionality
- loss of funds for the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform a call to the oracle and use most recent prices.
