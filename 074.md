# `NumaOracle::getV3SqrtPriceAvg` function will return incorrect price for negative ticks due to wrong rounding

### Summary

The [`NumaOracle::getV3SqrtPriceAvg`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaOracle.sol#L226-L247) function calculates and returns the `sqrtPriceX96` price. But the function doesn't take into account the case when the difference of the ticks can be negative. In that case the function returns wrong value because of wrong rounding of the value of the tick.

### Root Cause

Let's consider the `NumaOracle::getV3SqrtPriceAvg` function that is used to calculate the `sqrtPriceX96` price:

```solidity

function getV3SqrtPriceAvg(
    address _uniswapV3Pool,
    uint32 _interval
) public view returns (uint160) {
    require(_interval > 0, "interval cannot be zero");
    //Returns TWAP prices for short and long intervals
    uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
    secondsAgo[0] = _interval; // from (before)
    secondsAgo[1] = 0; // to (now)

    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool)
        .observe(secondsAgo);

    // tick(imprecise as it's an integer) to sqrtPriceX96
    return
        TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(
            int24(
@>              (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
                    int56(int32(_interval))
            )
        );
}

```

The function uses `IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool).observe(secondsAgo)` to get `tickCumulatives` array which is then used to calculate the tick and this tick is passed as input argument in `TickMatch::getSqrtRatioAtTick` function. The problem is that `tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]` can be negative. In that case the tick that is calculated as `int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(int32(_interval)))` should be rounded down as it's done in the [Uniswap library](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/libraries/OracleLibrary.sol#L36).

But this is not being done in the `NumaOracle::getV3SqrtPriceAvg` function. And given that `Solidity` division truncates the result, the effect of this truncation is different depending on the sign of the difference `int24(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0])`. If the difference is positive a truncation will decrease the value of the tick, but in the case if `int24(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0])` is negative and `(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) % secondsAgo != 0`, truncating its value increases the value of the tick. Then the returned tick will be bigger than it should be.

### Impact

If `int24(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0])` is negative and `(tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) % secondsAgo != 0`, then returned tick will be bigger then it should be, which opens possibility for some price manipulations and arbitrage opportunities.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate first the `tick`, check if the difference of the ticks is negative and then pass the `tick` as argument to the `getSqrtRatioAtTick` function:

```diff

function getV3SqrtPriceAvg(
    address _uniswapV3Pool,
    uint32 _interval
) public view returns (uint160) {
    require(_interval > 0, "interval cannot be zero");
    //Returns TWAP prices for short and long intervals
    uint32[] memory secondsAgo = new uint32[](2);
    secondsAgo[0] = _interval; // from (before)
    secondsAgo[1] = 0; // to (now)

    (int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool)
        .observe(secondsAgo);

+   int24 tick = (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(int32(_interval));
+   if (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0] < 0 && (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) % secondsAgo != 0) tick--;
    
    // tick(imprecise as it's an integer) to sqrtPriceX96
-   return
-       TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(
-           int24(
-              (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) /
-                    int56(int32(_interval))
-            )
-        );

+   return
+       TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tick);
}

```
