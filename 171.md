# When the price of lstToken drops, the reward calculation of `NumaVault` does not work correctly.

### Summary
Each time `updateVault()` is invoked, the variable `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is updated to reflect the current price of `lstToken`. Rewards are calculated only when the current price exceeds `last_lsttokenvalueWei`. Consequently, this approach can lead to calculated rewards that exceed the actual rewards, especially during periods of frequent price fluctuations of `lstToken`.

### Root Cause
Each time `updateVault()` is invoked, the variable `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is updated to reflect the current price of `lstToken`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L355
```solidity
        last_lsttokenvalueWei = currentvalueWei;
```

However, rewards are calculated only when the current price exceeds `last_lsttokenvalueWei`. It means that rewards will be 0 if the current price is lower than `last_lsttokenvalueWei`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L328-L344
```solidity
    function rewardsValue() public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        require(address(oracle) != address(0), "oracle not set");
        uint currentvalueWei = oracle.getTokenPrice(decimals);
@>      if (currentvalueWei <= last_lsttokenvalueWei) {
@>          return (0, currentvalueWei, 0);
        }
        uint diff = (currentvalueWei - last_lsttokenvalueWei);
        uint balance = getVaultBalanceNoDebt();
        uint rwd = FullMath.mulDiv(balance, diff, currentvalueWei);
        // extract from debt. Substract rewardsFromDebt as it's not supposed to be in the vault anymore
        uint debtRwd = FullMath.mulDiv(
            (debt - rewardsFromDebt),
            diff,
            currentvalueWei
        );
        return (rwd, currentvalueWei, debtRwd);
    }
```

Consequently, this approach can lead to calculated rewards that exceed the actual rewards, especially during periods of frequent price fluctuations of `lstToken`.

Consider the following scenario:
1. The price is of `lstToken` is 1.
2. The price decreases to 0.9.
3. The price returns back to 1.

In the above scenario, there is no actual rewards. In step 3, however, some rewards are sent to reward receiver, which leads to loss of fund to NUMA token holders.

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
none

### Impact
During periods of frequent price fluctuations of `lstToken`, liquidity providers may experience a loss of funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation
The rewards should be calculated only when the price of `lstToken` is larger than the max value of historical ones.
