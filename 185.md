# `NumaOracle::getTWAPPriceInEth` is return incorrect `ethAmount` for 1 NUMA.

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

`NumaOracle::getTWAPPriceInEth` isn't working as expected since it doesn't take into account the decimals precision of the tokens and it also uses the invert formula for the `sqrtPriceX96` conversion. This function uses `NUMA/USDC` Uniswap V3 Pool (deployed [here[(https://arbiscan.io/address/0x804aC8929612C34C9D218db133F18343D03618A1#readContract)) in order to calculate the USDC amount that is equivalent to 1 NUMA and then it takes this USDC amount and it is converting it to ETH using the chainlink price feed. However, the retrieval of USDC amount for 1 NUMA is not happening correctly. Let's see the function :
```solidity
    function getTWAPPriceInEth(
        address _numaPool,
        address _converter,
        uint _numaAmount,
        uint32 _interval
    ) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = getV3SqrtPriceAvg(_numaPool, _interval);

        uint256 numerator = (
            IUniswapV3Pool(_numaPool).token0() == token
                ? sqrtPriceX96
                : FixedPoint96.Q96
        );
        uint256 denominator = (
            numerator == sqrtPriceX96 ? FixedPoint96.Q96 : sqrtPriceX96
        );

@>        uint256 TokenPerNumaMulAmount = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(denominator, denominator, numerator),
            _numaAmount,
            numerator
        );

        uint EthPerNumaMulAmount = TokenPerNumaMulAmount;
        if (_converter != address(0)) {
            EthPerNumaMulAmount = INumaTokenToEthConverter(_converter)
                .convertTokenToEth(TokenPerNumaMulAmount);
        }

        return EthPerNumaMulAmount;
    }
```

The problem occurs in the highlighted part with the `@>`. There, the denominator which is `2^96` is being used as numerator and the inverse for the `sqrtPricex96`. This is wrong since `sqrtPricex96` in a pool where `token0 = NUMA` and `token1 = USDC`, represent the ratio USDC amount per 1 NUMA. Except from that the decimal precision of USDC is not taken into account from the function which doesn't devide by `1e6` in order to convert it to actual USDC amount.

### Impact

High. The TWAP price of NUMA in terms of ETH (as expected from the `getTWAPPriceInEth`) to be returning is totally broken and this will catastrophically affect the `buy fee pid` calculations in `VaultManager::updateBuyFeePID()` which is trying to retrieve the TWAP price of numa in terms of ETH and see what is the difference of it with the actual vault price and adjust buy fee pid. The `buy fee pid` calculations as a result will be gamed.
