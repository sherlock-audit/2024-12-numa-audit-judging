# Numa tokens fee on transfer can be bypassed

### Summary

The Numa token is designed in a way that if users want to transfer Numa tokens to a specific address present in `isIncludedInFees`, a fee will be applied. Additionally, if the `spender` address is in the `wlSpenders` list, no fee is charged

In the case of Uniswap, this design allows fees to be taken when users want to sell Numa tokens in Uniswap. The `wlSpenders` list includes the `UniswapV2Router` to ensure that liquidity providers do not have to pay fees when adding liquidity using the router

  ```solidity
  // cancel fee for some spenders. Typically, this will be used for UniswapV2Router which is used when adding liquidity
  if ((!ns.wlSpenders[spender]) && (fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to]) {
      _transferWithFee(from, to, value, fee);
  } else {
      super._transfer(from, to, value);
  }
  ```
  
However, the `UniswapV2Router` also includes functions such as `swapExactTokensForTokens`, which can be used to swap Numa tokens. Since the router is in the whitelist, no fees will be applied for the swap. This allows users to bypass the fee when selling their Numa tokens on Uniswap

### Root Cause

In [Numa.sol:95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L95),  if the spender is whitelisted, no fee will be charged. The whitelisted spender, UniswapV2Router, can also be used to sell Numa tokens, thereby bypassing the fee.
