# Missing Validation Allows Users to Enter Multiple Markets Despite Isolation Model

### Summary

The `NumaComptroller` contract is designed to operate under an isolated lending model, where users are intended to use only one asset as collateral and borrow one asset. However, the `enterMarkets` function lacks validation to enforce this restriction. Users can enter multiple markets, supply multiple collateral assets, and borrow multiple assets simultaneously. This discrepancy between the intended design and the actual implementation can lead to unexpected behaviors, inaccurate risk assessments, as the protocol's liquidity calculations and risk parameters are based on the assumption of isolation.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in the absence of validation within the `enterMarkets` function and related methods to enforce the isolated lending model. Specifically:

- **No Restriction on Market Entry:** The `enterMarkets` function allows users to enter multiple markets without any checks, enabling them to supply multiple collateral assets and borrow from multiple markets.

  ```solidity
  function enterMarkets(
      address[] memory cTokens
  ) public override returns (uint[] memory) {
      uint len = cTokens.length;
      uint[] memory results = new uint[](len);
      for (uint i = 0; i < len; i++) {
          CToken cToken = CToken(cTokens[i]);
          results[i] = uint(addToMarketInternal(cToken, msg.sender));
      }
      return results;
  }
  ```

- **Liquidity Calculations Assume Isolation:** Functions such as `getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` and `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` are designed to consider only two assets—a single collateral asset and a single borrowed asset—in their calculations. This assumption does not hold if users can enter multiple markets.

  ```solidity
  function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal(
      address account,
      CToken cTokenModify,
      uint redeemTokens,
      uint borrowAmount
  ) internal view returns (Error, uint, uint, uint) {
      // ...
      CToken otherToken;
      CToken[] memory assets = accountAssets[account];
      for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
          CToken asset = assets[i];
          if (address(asset) != address(cTokenModify)) {
              otherToken = asset;
              break;
          }
      }
      // Only 'cTokenModify' and 'otherToken' are considered in calculations
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **No Enforcement of Isolation Model:** There are no checks in place within `addToMarketInternal` or other functions to prevent users from entering multiple markets, contradicting the isolated lending assumption.

### Attack Path


1. **Entering Multiple Markets:**
   - A user calls `enterMarkets` with multiple `cToken` addresses, entering several markets.

     ```solidity
     address[] memory cTokens = new address[](2);
     cTokens[0] = address(cTokenA);
     cTokens[1] = address(cTokenB);
     numaComptroller.enterMarkets(cTokens);
     ```

2. **Supplying Multiple Collateral Assets:**
   - The user supplies collateral to both `cTokenA` and `cTokenB`, providing multiple assets as collateral.

     ```solidity
     cTokenA.mint(supplyAmountA);
     cTokenB.mint(supplyAmountB);
     ```

3. **Borrowing Multiple Assets:**
   - The user borrows assets from multiple markets, such as `cTokenC` and `cTokenD`.

     ```solidity
     cTokenC.borrow(borrowAmountC);
     cTokenD.borrow(borrowAmountD);
     ```

4. **Inaccurate Liquidity Calculations:**
   - The protocol's liquidity calculations only consider two assets and thus fail to accurately assess the user's liquidity and risk exposure.

5. **Breaking Isolation Assumptions:**
   - The protocol's risk parameters and safeguards are based on the assumption of isolated lending, which is violated in this scenario.


### Impact


- **Violation of Isolation Model:**
  - The protocol's intended isolated lending model is compromised, potentially leading to behaviors and risks not accounted for in the original design.

- **Inaccurate Risk Assessment:**
  - Liquidity and risk calculations become inaccurate, as they do not account for multiple collateral and borrowed assets, leading to potential underestimation of risk.

- **Protocol Vulnerability:**
  - The lack of enforcement can be exploited by malicious users to manipulate their borrowing capacity or evade liquidation,  resulting in financial losses for the protocol.

### PoC


1. **User Enters Multiple Markets:**

   The user enters multiple markets by calling `enterMarkets` with multiple `cToken` addresses:

   ```solidity
   address[] memory cTokens = new address[](2);
   cTokens[0] = address(cTokenA);
   cTokens[1] = address(cTokenB);
   numaComptroller.enterMarkets(cTokens);
   ```

2. **User Supplies Multiple Collateral Assets:**

   The user supplies collateral to both `cTokenA` and `cTokenB`:

   ```solidity
   cTokenA.mint(1_000 * 1e18); // Supplying Asset A
   cTokenB.mint(1_000 * 1e18); // Supplying Asset B
   ```

3. **User Borrows Multiple Assets:**

   The user borrows from multiple markets:

   ```solidity
   cTokenC.borrow(500 * 1e18); // Borrowing Asset C
   cTokenD.borrow(500 * 1e18); // Borrowing Asset D
   ```

4. **Liquidity Calculation Only Considers Two Assets:**

   The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` function only considers two assets, leading to inaccurate liquidity assessment:

   ```solidity
   CToken otherToken;
   CToken[] memory assets = accountAssets[account];
   for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
       CToken asset = assets[i];
       if (address(asset) != address(cTokenModify)) {
           otherToken = asset;
           break;
       }
   }
   // Only 'cTokenModify' and 'otherToken' are considered
   ```

5. **Consequences:**

   - The user's actual collateral and borrow positions are not fully accounted for.
   - The protocol may allow the user to borrow more than permitted or not trigger liquidation when necessary.

### Mitigation


- **Restrict Market Entry to One Market:**

  Modify the `enterMarkets` function to prevent users from entering more than one market:

  ```solidity
  function enterMarkets(
      address[] memory cTokens
  ) public override returns (uint[] memory) {
      require(cTokens.length == 1, "Can only enter one market");
      uint[] memory results = new uint[](1);
      CToken cToken = CToken(cTokens[0]);
      results[0] = uint(addToMarketInternal(cToken, msg.sender));
      return results;
  }
  ```

- **Enforce Isolation in `addToMarketInternal`:**

  Add a check to ensure the user is not already in another market:

  ```solidity
  function addToMarketInternal(
      CToken cToken,
      address borrower
  ) internal returns (Error) {
      Market storage marketToJoin = markets[address(cToken)];

      if (!marketToJoin.isListed) {
          return Error.MARKET_NOT_LISTED;
      }

      if (accountAssets[borrower].length > 0) {
          // User is already in a market
          return Error.ALREADY_IN_A_MARKET;
      }

      // Proceed to add user to the market
      marketToJoin.accountMembership[borrower] = true;
      accountAssets[borrower].push(cToken);

      emit MarketEntered(cToken, borrower);

      return Error.NO_ERROR;
  }
  ```

- **Restrict Borrowing to Single Asset:**

  Modify the `borrowAllowed` function to ensure users can only borrow from the market they have entered:

  ```solidity
  function borrowAllowed(
      address cToken,
      address borrower,
      uint borrowAmount
  ) external override returns (uint) {
      require(markets[cToken].accountMembership[borrower], "Borrower has not entered this market");

      // Rest of the function remains the same
      // ...
  }
  ```

- **Update Validation in Other Functions:**

  Ensure that all other relevant functions, such as `redeemAllowed`, `repayBorrowAllowed`, and liquidation functions, enforce the isolation model by validating that users are interacting with the single market they have entered.
