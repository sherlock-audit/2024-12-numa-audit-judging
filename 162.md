# Loss of users fund due to astronomically high sell fees in protocol's critical state

### Root Cause

Users are charged fees for depositing LSTs to mint $NUMA or for selling their $NUMA back to the vault to reclaim their deposited LSTs. These fees are crucial for NUMA as they contribute to the protocol's over-collateralization, positively impacting the price of the native token, $NUMA.

The fees associated with selling NUMA, particularly regarding this report, depend on several factors, including the critical state of the protocol. If either the protocol or the global collateral factor (CF) is deemed critical, an extra scaling factor is applied when calculating the selling fee based on the selling amount.

The problem here is that the fee charged in a critical state is too high because of the multiplier applied. In the scenario described below, the user loses half of the selling amount to selling fees.

1. Imagine a normal fee of 0.95 ether, which indicates a 5% sell fee.
2. The protocol is in a critical state, so an additional criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee of 4% is charged. Logically, this should push the total sell fee to 0.91 ether, representing a 9% sell fee.
3. However, due to the 10x critical multiplier applied on the criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, the additional fee is 40%, not 4%

    function getSellFeeScaling() public view returns (uint, uint, uint) {
          .....................................
          sell_fee_increaseCriticalCF =
            (sell_fee_increaseCriticalCF * sell_fee_criticalMultiplier) /
            1000;
          .....................................
  }
```
4. Put together, the result is a 45% sell fee, which means when a user attempts to sell their $NUMA and withdraw their LST, they lose close to half of their selling amount

### Impact

Loss of funds to the user who is withdrawing their LST and selling $NUMA to the vault.
