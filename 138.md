# NUMA sell fee can round down to zero and be bypassed by transferring small amounts in each iteration.

### Summary

Each NUMA ERC20 transfer from users has a sell fee which will be burned and **not** transferred to the recipient. This fee can be passed by the senders, if the send small amounts and the fee will round down to 0.

### Root Cause

In the transfer methods of NUMA ERC20 there is a sell fee when someone non whitelisted is transferring NUMA. This fee is supposed to be burned from the NUMA supply and increase the price of NUMA/ETH since the supply will be burned. Let's see the functions :

```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        NumaStorage storage ns = numaStorage();
        uint fee = ns.sellFeeBips;
        // spend allowance
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, value);
        // cancel fee for some spenders. Typically, this will be used for UniswapV2Router which is used when adding liquidity
        if ((!ns.wlSpenders[spender]) && (fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to]) {
            _transferWithFee(from, to, value, fee);
        } else {
            super._transfer(from, to, value);
        }

        return true;
    }
    function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override {
        // uniswap sell fee
        NumaStorage storage ns = numaStorage();
        uint fee = ns.sellFeeBips;
        // apply (burn) fee on some receivers. Typically, the UniswapV2Pair, to apply fee when selling on Uniswap.
        if ((fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to]) {
            _transferWithFee(from, to, amount, fee);
        } else {
            super._transfer(from, to, amount);
        }
    }
    function _transferWithFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee
    ) internal virtual {
        uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 10000;
        amount -= amountToBurn;
        _burn(from, amountToBurn);
        super._transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

However, as we can see in the `uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 10000;`, it is possible for users to bypass this fee if the transfer in each iteration a small amount. In this way, `amountToBurn` will be 0 and no fee will be applied. In chains like Arbitrum and Base with almost 0 fees, this is very possible and profitable.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User transfers in a loop, small amounts and the `uint256 amountToBurn = amount * feeBips / 10000;` is rounding down to zero so not fee is applied.

### Impact

Medium. Users can easily bypass a core intention of the NUMA protocol and safety measures (since it is supposed to increase the price of NUMA in each transfer by reducing the NUMA supply) and don't pay the sell fee that they are supposed to.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider introducing a minimum fee amount to be accepted.
