# Vault is getting "drained" during repayments because it is not checked if the debt repaid is actually the debt which accrued the `rewardsFromDebt`.

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The `Vault::repay()` function is supposed to getting the `rETH` back from the borrowers and also sending to the `rwd_address` the rewards from debt that were extracted. Let's see the function :
```solidity
    function repay(uint _amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(cLstToken));
        require(_amount > 0, "amount <= 0");
        require(_amount <= debt, "repay more than debt");

        updateVaultAndUpdateDebasing();

        // repay
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            lstToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _amount
        );
        // we will use some repaid amount as rewards from our accumulated virtual rewards from debt
@>        uint extractedRwdFromDebt = FullMath.mulDiv(
            rewardsFromDebt,
            _amount,
            debt
        );

        if ((extractedRwdFromDebt > 0) && (rwd_address != address(0))) {
            rewardsFromDebt -= extractedRwdFromDebt;
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(lstToken),
                rwd_address,
                extractedRwdFromDebt
            );
            if (isContract(rwd_address) && isRwdReceiver) {
                // we don't check result as contract might not implement the deposit function (if multi sig for example)
                rwd_address.call(
                    abi.encodeWithSignature(
                        "DepositFromVault(uint256)",
                        extractedRwdFromDebt
                    )
                );
            }
            emit RewardsDebtExtracted(extractedRwdFromDebt);
        }

        debt = debt - _amount;
        emit RepaidVault(_amount);
    }
```

However, it doesn't check if that debt is the one that accrued the rewards. For example, there may be a debt that has accrued almost all rewards in it for lot of days but if someone takes a loan and repay it today (which means no rewards will be accrued for this debt) he will actually send some rewards to the `rwd_address`. This will mean that rETH that were supposed to be staying in the vault and wait for the actual `rETH` rewards to be sent to the `rwd_address`, will be send instead. This, of course, will cause a problem to the collateralization of the `Vault` since more `rETH` than what it should, will be moved out of the vault.

The problem occurs due to the fact that the repaid amount is only compared to the total debt, and depending on this, it transfers out the `rewardsFromDebt`.

### Attack Path

1. A borrow is happening.
2. Time passes and this debt accrued `rewardsFromDebt` but it is not yet repaid.
3. A new borrow is happening of rETH which is as big as the old one.
4. In the same day, that new borrow is repaid.
5. The new borrow didn't accrue any rewards but it will actually send half of the `rewardsFromDebt` to the `rwd_address`.

This effectively is translated to that rETH that were supposed to be staying in the vault, will be moved out reducing the collateralization of the vault until the old debt that had actually accrued that rewards to be repaid.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is **High** since the vault `rETH` balance will be decreased unexpectedly and it will be needed for the actual debt that accrued the `rewardsFromDebt` to be repaid so the normal case of collateralization to be returned in the Vault. Also, if the amount of debt that did not accrued the debt is big enough compared to the debt that actually accrued the debt, it can cause liquidity insufficiencies in the vault.
