# An attacker can steal the first deposit of cToken markets by inflating exchange rate

### Summary

The lending part of the protocol, being a fork of Compound v2, is vulnerable to the well-known ERC4626 "first depositor" attack. This vulnerability allows an attacker to steal funds from the first depositor of a market.

### Root Cause

The CToken is a yield bearing asset which is minted when any user deposits some units of
`underlying` tokens. The amount of CTokens minted to a user is calculated based upon
the amount of `underlying` tokens user is depositing.

As per the implementation of CToken contract, there exist two cases for CToken amount calculation:

1. First deposit - when `CToken.totalSupply()` is `0`.
2. All subsequent deposits.

Here is the actual CToken code (extra code and comments clipped for better reading):

```solidity
function exchangeRateStoredInternal() virtual internal view returns (uint) {
    uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
    if (_totalSupply == 0) {
        return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
    } else {
        uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
        uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
        uint exchangeRate = cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale / _totalSupply;
        return exchangeRate;
    }
}

function mintFresh(address minter, uint mintAmount) internal {
    // ...
    Exp memory exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateStoredInternal()});

    uint actualMintAmount = doTransferIn(minter, mintAmount);

    uint mintTokens = div_(actualMintAmount, exchangeRate);

    totalSupply = totalSupply + mintTokens;
    accountTokens[minter] = accountTokens[minter] + mintTokens;
    // ...
}
```

The above implementation contains a critical bug which can be exploited to steal funds of
initial depositors of a freshly deployed CToken contract.

As the exchange rate is dependent upon the ratio of CToken's totalSupply and underlying token
balance of CToken contract, the attacker can craft transactions to manipulate the exchange rate.

### Attack Path

1. Once the CToken has been deployed and added to the lending protocol, the attacker mints the 
smallest possible amount of CTokens.

2. Then the attacker does a plain `underlying` token transfer to the CToken contract, artificially inflating the `underlying.balanceOf(CToken)` value.

    Due to the above steps, during the next legitimate user deposit, the `mintTokens` value for
the user will become less than `1` and essentially be rounded down to `0` by Solidity.
Hence the user gets `0` CTokens against his deposit and the CToken's entire supply is held by the Attacker.

3. The Attacker can then simply `reedem` his CToken balance for the entire `underlying` token balance of the
CToken contract.

The same steps can be performed again to steal the next user's deposit.

It should be noted that the attack can happen in two ways:

- The attacker can simply execute the Step 1 and 2 as soon as the CToken gets added to the lending protocol.
- The attacker watches the pending transactions of the network and frontruns the user's deposit transaction by executing Step 1 and 2 and then backruns it with Step 3. 

### Impact

An attacker can steal the whole deposit amount of first depositor.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The fix to prevent this issue would be to enforce a minimum deposit that cannot be withdrawn. This can be done by minting small amount of CToken units to 0x00 address on the first deposit.

```solidity
function mintFresh(address minter, uint mintAmount) internal {
    // ...
    Exp memory exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateStoredInternal()});

    uint actualMintAmount = doTransferIn(minter, mintAmount);

    uint mintTokens = div_(actualMintAmount, exchangeRate);

    /// THE FIX
    if (totalSupply == 0) {
        totalSupply = 1000;
        accountTokens[address(0)] = 1000;
        mintTokens -= 1000;
    }

    totalSupply = totalSupply + mintTokens;
    accountTokens[minter] = accountTokens[minter] + mintTokens;
    // ...
}
```
Instead of a fixed 1000 value an admin controlled parameterized value can also be used to control the burn amount on a per CToken basis.
