_No response_

### Root Cause

 In NumaVault.sol at line 35, states for each buy and sell in the fault a fee of 20% is taken
```javascript
  // fee that is sent to fee_address
    // percentage of buy/sell fee in base 1000
    uint16 public fees = 200; //20%
```
This is clearly an excessive amount and lead to large loss for users
