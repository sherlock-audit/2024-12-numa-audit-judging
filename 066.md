# Protocol ignores debt rewards when checking if rewards are above threshold

## Summary
The following check inside [extractRewardsNoRequire()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L383) should be modified as follows to include the debt reward while comparing with `rwd_threshold`. Identical logic exists inside [lstToNuma()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L697) and [numaToLst()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L719):
```diff
    function extractRewardsNoRequire() internal {
        if (block.timestamp >= (last_extracttimestamp + 24 hours)) {
            (
                uint256 rwd,
                uint256 currentvalueWei,
                uint256 rwdDebt
            ) = rewardsValue();
-           if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
+           if (rwd + rwdDebt > rwd_threshold) {
                extractInternal(rwd, currentvalueWei, rwdDebt);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Description
Consider the following flow:
- `rwd_threshold` is set as `1 ether`. Note that currently it's set at `0` but can be readily changed by the owner calling [setRewardsThreshold()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L296)
- Inside vault, total rEth value in ETH is `8 ETH` (for ease of calculation, let's say 1 rEth = 8 ETH)
- A 25% rebase occurs pushing rEth value to `10 ETH`. Vault can be updated via `updateVault()` which internally calls `extractRewardsNoRequire()` if 24 hours have passed since the last update. We'll assume it has been more than 24 hours.
- Case 1:
    - No debts.
    - `updateVault() --> extractRewardsNoRequire() --> rewardsValue()` is called.
    - `rwd` is evaluated as `2 ether` and `debtRwd = 0`.
    - Since `rwd > rwd_threshold` is `true`, `extractInternal()` will be called, rewards distributed and `last_lsttokenvalueWei` will be updated to the new price of `10 ETH`
- Case 2:
    - Debt value = 6 ETH.
    - `updateVault() --> extractRewardsNoRequire() --> rewardsValue()` is called.
    - `rwd` is evaluated as `0.8 ether` and `debtRwd = 1.2 ether`.
    - Since `rwd > rwd_threshold` is `false`, `extractInternal()` will be not be called, [rewardsFromDebt is not incremented on L358](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L358), rewards not distributed,  and `last_lsttokenvalueWei` not updated to the new price of `10 ETH`
        - In case of [lstToNuma()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L697) and [numaToLst()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L719), `refValue` is not updated to `currentvalueWei`

## Impact
Stale values used if vault has debt, leading to incorrect accounting across the protocol.

## Mitigation 
Add `rwdDebt` to `rwd` whenever comparing with `rwd_threshold`:
```diff
-           if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
+           if (rwd + rwdDebt > rwd_threshold) {
```
