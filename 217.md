# Whitelisted users are not checked in the printer

### Summary

## Summary
Fee whitelisted members don't pay fees when burning/minting Numa in the vault, but pay fees in the printer due to a missing check.
## Description
Vault owners can add people to a fee whitelist mapping to relieve them off fees owed for burning/minting Numa. 
```solidity
        uint fee = vaultManager.getBuyFee();
        if (feeWhitelisted[msg.sender]) {
            fee = 1 ether; // max percent (= no fee)
        }
```
These checks are correctly implemented in `buy` and `sell` functions in `NumaVault.sol`. However no such checks are performed in `NumaPrinter.sol`. All conversions in the printer use formulas from the vault manager contract which have `getBuyFee` and `getSellFeeScaling` embedded within them. Fee whitelisted members are supposed to be overall relieved from the fees specified in `VaultManager.sol`, however they are charged when minting/burning nuAssets.

To put it in another perspective:
If a whitelisted user wishes to burn numa in the vault they will be assigned a sell fee through `getSellFeeScaling` and then have it written off.
If a whitelisted user wishes to burn numa in the printer they will be assigned a sell fee through `getSellFeeScaling` and will pay it.
The same user interacts with the very same fee twice with 2 different outcomes.

NB! In the current code there is an issue where buy/sell fees are applied incorrectly and users end up receiving the fee instead of paying it. This is a subject of another submission. In the current submission it is assumed that the former one is fixed/non-existent.

### Root Cause

- [`NumaPrinter`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L18) does not perform a check whether `msg.sender` is a whitelisted user 

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, missing code

### Impact

Unexpected behaviour

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add whitelist checks in printer too or perform the whitelist check in `VaultManager.sol` exclusively on all conversion methods.
