# Double Fee Deduction Due to Overlapping Fee Logic in transferFrom and _transfer Functions

### Summary

The fee logic is implemented in both the _transfer and transferFrom functions of [NUMA.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L84) Contract, but there is an overlap in how the fee is calculated and applied. This could lead to double fee deduction or unintended behavior when transferFrom is called since transferFrom internally calls _transfer.

### Root Cause

- In transferFrom, the _transferWithFee method might deduct a fee again even if it has already been deducted in _transfer, leading to double fee deduction for the same transaction.
- This could occur because super._transfer(from, to, value) is overridden in _transferWithFee.

### Internal pre-conditions

Setup:

- Assume spender is not a whitelisted spender (!ns.wlSpenders[spender] == true).
- The recipient (to) is flagged for fees (ns.isIncludedInFees[to] == true).
- fee > 0.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Function Call:

- transferFrom(from, to, value) is called by the spender.

Execution in transferFrom:

- The if condition in transferFrom evaluates to true, so _transferWithFee(from, to, value, fee) is called.
- _transferWithFee applies the fee and burns the appropriate tokens.

Internal Call to _transfer:

- _transferWithFee internally calls _transfer via super._transfer(from, to, value).
- Since _transfer also contains fee logic, it checks (fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to] again.This condition evaluates to true in _transfer, and the fee is applied a second time through _transferWithFee.

### Impact

Users transferring tokens via transferFrom will lose more tokens than expected due to the fee being deducted twice.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, consolidate the fee logic to avoid duplication. Specifically:

- Remove fee logic from transferFrom.
- Centralize fee deduction logic in _transfer.
