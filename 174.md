# accrueInterest() can return big interest and revert many functions on specific chains

### Summary

`CToken:accrueInterest()` and `CNumaToken:accrueInterest()` both use the `blockDelta` to multiply and calculate the interest. The problem arises because different blockchains have different block times. Therefore the 1 block on Ethereum (Block Time 12s) will be equivalent to 46 blocks on Arbitrum (Block Time 0.26s). This will cause the Numa interest to be 46 times bigger on Arbitrum and something less big on Base (Block Time 2s). Eventually leading to a bigger loss of funds for users on different blockchains.

There is also another vulnerability containing `borrowRateMaxMantissa`. The purpose of the variable is to stop the execution when the borrowing rate is absurd. The problem arises because the `borrowRateMantissa` is calculated through `getBorrowRate` and the function `// calculates the current borrow interest rate per block` as stated in the `InterestRateModel.sol`. If the time of blocks is different it can cause the `borrowRateMantissa` to be high on some chains and hit the `borrowRateMaxMantissa` limit. Causing all functions which have `accrueInterest()` to revert.

### Impact

On Arbitrum the interest will be 46 times bigger than on Ethereum.  And on Base, it will be 6 times bigger than on Ethereum. 

The `borrowRateMantissa` will be bigger on different chains, therefore it will much more easily hit the `borrowRateMaxMantissa` limit and revert all functions using `accrueInterest()`.

### Recommendation

Multiply the `blockDelta` with a variable specific for each chain, to make sure the `blockDelta` will be the same on every chain.

Change `borrowRateMaxMantissa` according to the chain to which it is being deployed.
