# Precision loss in setMaxSpotOffsetBps function leads to Incorrect Numa Prices

### Summary

Due to precision loss in `NumaOracle.setMaxSpotOffsetBps()`, the spot price is modified (increased or decreased) by incorrect percentages, resulting in incorrect prices.


### Root Cause

Due to precision loss during the calculation of `maxSpotOffsetPlus1SqrtBps` and `maxSpotOffsetMinus1SqrtBps`, the spot price from the LP increases or decreases by more than the desired percentage.


```solidity
    function setMaxSpotOffsetBps(uint _maxSpotOffsetBps) external onlyOwner {
        require(_maxSpotOffsetBps < 10000, "percentage must be less than 100");
         // @audit-issue precision loss here
         maxSpotOffsetPlus1SqrtBps =
            100 *
            uint160(Math.sqrt(10000 + _maxSpotOffsetBps));
        // @audit-issue precision loss here
        maxSpotOffsetMinus1SqrtBps =
            100 *
            uint160(Math.sqrt(10000 - _maxSpotOffsetBps));

        emit MaxSpotOffsetBps(_maxSpotOffsetBps);
    }
```

For example, letâ€™s say `_maxSpotOffsetBps = 145` (1.45% as mentioned in the documentation). 
In this case, `maxSpotOffsetPlus1SqrtBps` should ideally be `10072`. However, since `Math.sqrt(10000 + 145) = 100.72`, it will be rounded down to `100` in Solidity. As a result, `maxSpotOffsetPlus1SqrtBps` will be set to `10000` instead of `10072`. This means that, instead of increasing the spot price by 1.45%, the spot price will remain unchanged.

Similarly, for `maxSpotOffsetMinus1SqrtBps`, it will be set to `9900` instead of `9927`. This results in the spot price decreasing by 1.99% instead of the intended 1.45%.
