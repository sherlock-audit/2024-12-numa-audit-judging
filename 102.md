# Calculation Error in Synthetic Asset(nuAsset) Swapping

## Summary
Calculation error found in the `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuAsset` function in `NumaOracle.sol`, which leads to incorrect amount of nuAsset swapping.

## Description
### Severity: High
Assume, you want to get 100 nuBTC converted into nuUSD by the `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuAsset` function (which is called in several functions in `NumaPrinter.sol`) in `NumaOracle.sol` . In this function 100 Eth>> xUSD is performed first by `nuAManager.ethToNuAsset()` and the output(x) is then converted as BTC>>Eth in `nuAManager.nuAssetToEth()` function. Which gives an approximate conversion , but not appropriate , because of wrong conversion route (Which should be  BTC>>ETH>>USD). Actually , it provides a  higher BTC>>USD rate of  exchange, which leads to financial loss to the protocol. And if vice-versa(nuUSD>>nuBTC), functions like `swapExactInput` may revert due to slippage check([NumaPrinter.sol#L714](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L714)).

### Impact
- It directly impacts nuAsset swappings causing significant financial losses of users and the protocol itself.
- It could lead to **exploitation** by malicious actors, amplifying the impact.


## Recommendation
The issue can be solved by changing in [NumaOracle.sol#L515-L524] as follows:
```solidity
        uint256 nuAssetOutPerETHmulAmountIn = nuAManager.**nuAssetToEth**(
            **_nuAssetIn**,
            _nuAssetAmountIn
        );
        uint256 tokensForAmount = nuAManager.**ethToNuAsset**(
            **_nuAssetOut**,
            nuAssetOutPerETHmulAmountIn
        );
        return tokensForAmount;
```
