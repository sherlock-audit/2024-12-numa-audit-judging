# Flash loan liquidations to liquidate LST borrowers can be DoS'd

### Summary

When calling [`liquidateLstBorrower()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1113), there is a `bool _flashloan` parameter, to determine whether the debt will be repaid via the user's own LST, or the vault's LST. This can be DoS'd due to the `minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation`.

### Root Cause

In `liquidateLstBorrower()`, the liquidation must be a full liquidation, unless the `borrowAmount` of the borrower is greater than `minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation`, which is `10 ether`.

The problem is that when there is high util, and a large amount of LST is borrowed, there can be less than `10 ether` available in the `NumaVault`.

This causes flash loan liquidations (which use the vault's LST to repay the debt) to revert here:
```solidity
IERC20(lstToken).approve(address(cLstToken), lstAmount);
cLstToken.liquidateBorrow(
    _borrower,
    lstAmount,
    CTokenInterface(address(cNuma))
);
```
(since the `lstAmount` is not available in the contract)

If the loan to be liquidated is `9.9 ether`, it has to be liquidated fully. And since a flashloan liquidation is not possible, the only way is for the liquidation bot to have 9.9e18 ($40k+) of rETH ready, which is unreasonable.

### Attack Path

1. Large amounts of rETH (e.g 9e18) are separately borrowed from the vault, until the available funds is less than 9e18
2. NUMA price drops, causing the positions to be liquidatable
3. The positions cannot be liquidated via the `_flashloan` option, due to the lack of funds in the vault. They cannot be partially liquidated since they are less than 10e18 rETH. The liquidator bots will need to have 9e18 rETH to liquidate each position.

### Impact

Flash loan liquidations of LST borrows will revert. For large borrows which cannot be partially liquidated (like 9.9 rETH), the liquidator bot will have to have 9.9 rETH in order for the liquidation to occur. Due to not being liquidatable, the position can go into bad debt causing loss to NUMA holders.

### Mitigation

The following recommendation to be applied [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1135-L1138) ensures that partial liquidations can occur when the LST balance of the vault is less than the preset min amount. This would allow flash loan liquidations to occur using the available vault funds and liquidate any unhealthy loans.

```diff
        uint minAmount = minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation;
        if (borrowAmount < minAmount) minAmount = borrowAmount;
+       if (lstToken.balanceOf(address(this)) < minAmount) minAmount = lstToken.balanceOf(address(this));
        require(lstAmount >= minAmount, "min liquidation");
```
