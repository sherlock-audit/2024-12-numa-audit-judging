# borrowers can be immediately liquidated

### Summary

When a market is marked as deprecated, there is no check to ensure that borrowing from the market has been disabled. As a result, a user could borrow from this market and become immediately eligible for liquidation

here we can see that this code checks if the borrower is in the market if not adds him to the market so the borrower can continue borrowing

there is no check whatsoever that makes sure the borrower isnt borrowing from a deprecated market

while in the liquidation process the function allows the borrower to be liquidated instantly even if his position is healthy

          function liquidateBorrowAllowed(
        address cTokenBorrowed,
        address cTokenCollateral,
        address liquidator,
        address borrower,
        uint repayAmount
    ) external view override returns (uint) {
        // Shh - currently unused
        liquidator;
        require((cTokenBorrowed) != (cTokenCollateral), "not isolate");
        if (
            !markets[cTokenBorrowed].isListed ||
            !markets[cTokenCollateral].isListed
        ) {
            return uint(Error.MARKET_NOT_LISTED);
        }


        uint borrowBalance = CToken(cTokenBorrowed).borrowBalanceStored(
            borrower
        );


        /* allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated */
        if (isDeprecated(CToken(cTokenBorrowed))) { /// ------>@audit 
            require(
                borrowBalance >= repayAmount,
                "Can not repay more than the total borrow"
            );
        } else {
            /* The borrower must have shortfall in order to be liquidatable */
            (
                Error err,
                ,
                uint shortfall,
                uint badDebt
            ) = getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal(
                    borrower,
                    CNumaToken(cTokenCollateral),
                    CNumaToken(cTokenBorrowed)
                );

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

loss of funds for borrower due to instant liquidation also the code adds the borrower to the market so this is 
very likely to happen
