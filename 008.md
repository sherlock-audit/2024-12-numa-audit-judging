# Buy fee doesn't increase in a case it is supposed to

### Vulnerability Detail

Upon mints/burns of `nuAssets` and the TWAP price being within 2% of the vault buy price, the fee should increase. This can also be confirmed by the [docs](https://numa-1.gitbook.io/numa-v3-white-paper/mechanics/the-vault#dynamic-fee-model):
>For every $1 of nuMoney burned or minted when the $NUMA LP 15min & 30min TWAP prices are within 2% of the buy price, the buy fee increases by 0.0001%. 

However, such a thing does not happen in the code. The only block reachable through a `nuAsset` mint/burn (due to `_isVaultBuy` being false), is the one where the TWAP price is more than 2.5% lower than the vault buy price, in that case the fee decreases.
