# Liquidity Calculations Consider Only Two Assets, Allowing Users to Exceed Borrowing Limits and Avoid Liquidation

### Summary

The `NumaComptroller` contract's liquidity and liquidation calculations only consider two assets—a single collateral asset and a single borrow asset—when evaluating a user's account liquidity. This design overlooks any additional assets a user may have supplied or borrowed. Since the protocol doesn't enforce restrictions on the number of markets a user can enter or the assets they can supply, users can hold multiple collateral assets and borrow multiple assets. Consequently, liquidity calculations are incorrect, potentially allowing users to over-borrow and avoid liquidation, which can lead to protocol insolvency.

### Root Cause

The functions `getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal`, `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal`, and related methods only account for one collateral and one borrow asset in their computations. The protocol lacks enforcement mechanisms to limit users to a single collateral and borrow asset, leading to inaccurate liquidity assessments when users have multiple assets.

```solidity
function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal(
    address account,
    CToken cTokenModify,
    uint redeemTokens,
    uint borrowAmount
) internal view returns (Error, uint, uint, uint) {
    AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars; // Holds all our calculation results
    uint oErr;

    // Only consider cTokenModify and one other asset
    CToken otherToken;
    CToken[] memory assets = accountAssets[account];
    for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
        CToken asset = assets[i];
        if (address(asset) != address(cTokenModify)) {
            otherToken = asset;
            break;
        }
    }

    CNumaToken collateral = CNumaToken(address(cTokenModify));
    CNumaToken borrow = CNumaToken(address(otherToken));

    if (borrowAmount > 0) {
        // Swap collateral and borrow if borrowAmount > 0
        collateral = CNumaToken(address(otherToken));
        borrow = CNumaToken(address(cTokenModify));
    }

    // ... (Liquidity calculations using only 'collateral' and 'borrow')
}
```

This function incorrectly assumes that the user is interacting with only two assets, ignoring any additional assets in `accountAssets[account]`. There are no protocol-level restrictions preventing users from supplying or borrowing multiple assets, leading to incomplete liquidity assessments.

### Attack Path


1. **Supply Multiple Collateral Assets:**
   - A user supplies multiple assets (e.g., Asset A and Asset B) to the protocol as collateral.

2. **Borrow Multiple Assets:**
   - The user borrows one or more assets (e.g., Asset C and Asset D).

3. **Bypass Accurate Liquidity Checks:**
   - The protocol's liquidity calculation functions only consider two assets, neglecting additional supplied or borrowed assets.

4. **Over-Borrowing Beyond Limits:**
   - Due to the incomplete calculation, the user is allowed to borrow more than permitted based on their total collateral, as only a portion of their collateral is considered.

5. **Avoid Liquidation:**
   - The user's position is not flagged for liquidation even if they are under-collateralized, because the extra borrowed assets are not accounted for in the liquidity check.

### Impact


- **Excessive Borrowing:**
  Users can borrow more assets than their collateral would allow, based on protocol rules.

- **Under-Collateralization Risks:**
  The protocol may be unable to cover the borrowed amounts if users default, leading to insolvency.


### PoC


1. **User Supplies Multiple Collaterals:**

   The user supplies two collateral assets:

   - **Asset A:** Supplies 1,000 tokens priced at $1 each, with a collateral factor of 0.8.

     ```solidity
     cTokenA.mint(1_000 * 1e18);
     ```

   - **Asset B:** Supplies 1,000 tokens priced at $1 each, with a collateral factor of 0.8.

     ```solidity
     cTokenB.mint(1_000 * 1e18);
     ```

2. **User Borrows Multiple Assets:**

   The user borrows an asset:

   - **Asset C:** Borrows 1,500 tokens priced at $1 each.

     ```solidity
     cTokenC.borrow(1_500 * 1e18);
     ```

3. **Expected Liquidity Calculation:**

   Total collateral should be calculated as:

   ```solidity
   totalCollateral = (SupplyA * PriceA * CollateralFactorA) + (SupplyB * PriceB * CollateralFactorB);
   totalCollateral = ($1,000 * 0.8) + ($1,000 * 0.8) = $1,600;
   ```

   The user should be allowed to borrow up to $1,600.

4. **Actual Liquidity Calculation Due to Bug:**

   The `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` function only considers one collateral and one borrowed asset. Suppose it picks Asset A as collateral and Asset C as the borrow:

   ```solidity
   // Only Asset A and Asset C are considered
   totalCollateral = SupplyA * PriceA * CollateralFactorA;
   totalCollateral = $1,000 * 0.8 = $800;
   ```

   The protocol incorrectly calculates the total collateral as $800 instead of $1,600.

5. **Over-Borrowing and Avoiding Liquidation:**

   The user has borrowed $1,500, but the liquidity calculation only sees $800 in collateral. Despite this discrepancy, the protocol allows the borrow and does not liquidate the under-collateralized position due to the flawed calculation.


### Mitigation

**Iterate Over All Assets:**

  Update the liquidity calculation functions to consider all assets in `accountAssets[account]`. This ensures that all supplied collateral and all borrowed assets are included in the liquidity assessment.

  **Modified Code Example:**

  ```solidity
  function getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal(
      address account,
      CToken cTokenModify,
      uint redeemTokens,
      uint borrowAmount
  ) internal view returns (Error, uint, uint, uint) {
      AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars; // Holds all calculation results
      uint oErr;

      // Iterate over all assets supplied by the user
      CToken[] memory assets = accountAssets[account];
      for (uint i = 0; i < assets.length; i++) {
          CToken asset = assets[i];

          // Skip the asset if it's being redeemed and redeemTokens > 0
          if (asset == cTokenModify && redeemTokens > 0) continue;

          // Get the user's balance and exchange rate from the cToken
          (oErr, vars.cTokenBalance, vars.borrowBalance, vars.exchangeRateMantissa) = asset.getAccountSnapshot(account);
          if (oErr != 0) {
              return (Error.SNAPSHOT_ERROR, 0, 0, 0);
          }

          vars.collateralFactor = Exp({mantissa: markets[address(asset)].collateralFactorMantissa});
          vars.exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: vars.exchangeRateMantissa});

          // Get the normalized price of the asset as collateral
          vars.oraclePriceMantissaCollateral = oracle.getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral(CNumaToken(address(asset)));
          if (vars.oraclePriceMantissaCollateral == 0) {
              return (Error.PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0, 0);
          }
          vars.oraclePriceCollateral = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissaCollateral});

          // Calculate the collateral value
          vars.tokensToDenomCollateral = mul_(mul_(vars.collateralFactor, vars.exchangeRate), vars.oraclePriceCollateral);
          vars.sumCollateral = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.tokensToDenomCollateral, vars.cTokenBalance, vars.sumCollateral);
      }

      // Include the asset being redeemed
      if (redeemTokens > 0) {
          // ... Similar calculations for redeemTokens ...
      }

      // Iterate over all borrowed assets
      for (uint i = 0; i < allMarkets.length; i++) {
          CToken asset = allMarkets[i];

          // Get the user's borrowed balance from the cToken
          uint borrowbalance = asset.borrowBalanceStored(account);

          // Skip if no borrow balance
          if (borrowbalance == 0) continue;

          // Get the normalized price of the borrowed asset
          vars.oraclePriceMantissaBorrowed = oracle.getUnderlyingPriceAsBorrowed(CNumaToken(address(asset)));
          if (vars.oraclePriceMantissaBorrowed == 0) {
              return (Error.PRICE_ERROR, 0, 0, 0);
          }
          vars.oraclePriceBorrowed = Exp({mantissa: vars.oraclePriceMantissaBorrowed});

          // Calculate the borrowed value
          vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(vars.oraclePriceBorrowed, borrowbalance, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects);
      }

      // Include the asset being borrowed
      if (borrowAmount > 0) {
          // ... Similar calculations for borrowAmount ...
      }

      // Final liquidity calculation
      if (vars.sumCollateral > vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects) {
          return (Error.NO_ERROR, vars.sumCollateral - vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects, 0, 0);
      } else {
          return (Error.NO_ERROR, 0, vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects - vars.sumCollateral, 0);
      }
  }
