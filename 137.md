# protocol allows frontrunning borrows

### Summary

protocol allows frontrunning borrows when a borrowing is being executed

Since  borrowFresh increases exchangeRateStored value which affects in the final exchange rate calculation used in functions such as mintFresh  and  redeemFresh an attacker could perform a front-run to any borrowing by minting tokens beforehand, and redeem these tokens after borrowing transaction is executed . In this situation, the attacker would always be making profit since total borrows value is increased after every borrowing which is directly used to calculate the exchange rate

    function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            /*
             * If there are no tokens minted:
             *  exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate
             */
            return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
        } else {
            /*
             * Otherwise:
             *  exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
             */
            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;


            return exchangeRate;

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1.attacker sees a borrow transaction in the mempool
2.attacker frontruns the transaction and mints tokens by calling the mintfunction
3.borrowers transaction is executed which increases the exchange rate exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
4.attackers redeems his tokens and successfully make a profit without adding any value for the protocol


### Impact

An attacker could always get profits from front-running borrows by taking advantage of exchangeRateStored calculation before a borrow  is made.
