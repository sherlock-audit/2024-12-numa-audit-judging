# Incorrect Numa fee logic

### Summary

Incorrect fee checks on internal `_transfer()` cause users to pay fee, when they are expected to not. 

### Root Cause


The `Numa.sol` has two fee related mappings; 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaStore.sol#L5
```solidity
    struct NumaStorage {
        uint sellFeeBips;
        mapping(address => bool) isIncludedInFees;
        mapping(address => bool) wlSpenders;
    }
```
if `wlSpenders[addr]==true || isIncludedInFees[addr]==false`, no fee is supposed to be charge to the `addr`. 

From the *scripts/NumaToken/updateFee.js* and code comments, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/scripts/NumaToken/updateFee.js
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L94

, we can say, no fee will charge if spender is router(or `wlSpenders[router]==true`). 


Consider a user `addLiquidity()` via router,  

1. Router calls transferFrom on numa token, since `wlSpenders[router]==true`, the [`fee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L95) get bypass and proceed to internal `_transfer()` call 

2. The internal ERC20 [`_transfer()` function is override](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L103) by numa, and since `isIncludedInFees[pair]==true`, it charges fee when transferring it to pair from router [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery/blob/0335e8f7e1bd1e8d8329fd300aea2ef2f36dd19f/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L73-L74)
```solidity
    function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override {
        // uniswap sell fee
        NumaStorage storage ns = numaStorage();
        uint fee = ns.sellFeeBips;
        // apply (burn) fee on some receivers. Typically, the UniswapV2Pair, to apply fee when selling on Uniswap.
        if ((fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to]) {
            _transferWithFee(from, to, amount, fee);
        } else {
            super._transfer(from, to, amount);
        }
    }
```
Note that the `_transfer()` here is expected to [charge fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L111)(see above comment), in case users try to sell/swap luma for any other token on uniswap. However, the case where users provides liquidity, the logic above also charges fee to users providing liquidity in numa tokens, where its expected to not(as can be inferred from the comment as well).

> // cancel fee for some spenders. Typically, this will be used for UniswapV2Router which is used when adding liquidity

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users end up paying extra in fees when they are expected to not.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override the `transfer()` function instead of internal `_transfer()` to charge fee on selling of numa tokens only,
