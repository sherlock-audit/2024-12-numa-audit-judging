# borrowAllowed() doesn't check for deprecated status that can leading to Instant Liquidation

### Summary

when a user is borrowing the code checks if the borrower is in the market and if not itadds them to the market so the borrower can continue borrowing

The problem is there is no check that makes sure the borrower is not borrowing from a deprecated market
and in the liquidateborrow function the function allows the borrower to be liquidated instantly even if his position is healthy(if its a deprecated market as the overall market health will be bad most of the time) and a attacker can monitor this and take profit from this type of situation
