```

From the code snipet above
- the `_supportMarket()` cannot be called on a market that is already set (L1682)
- calling `_supportMarket()` can only set the market to `true` (L1693)
- also, the comment states

The problem is that in a situation where the protocol intends to disable support for a market, there will be no way to do this leading to a DOS.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This protocol is missing a core functionality to disable market, and as such any added market can never be disabled leading to a DOS.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a function to disable markets or better still modify the `_supportMarket()`function to allow admin to enable and disable markets
