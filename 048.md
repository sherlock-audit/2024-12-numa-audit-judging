# Malformed Authorization Check in Admin Acceptance Allows Privilege Escalation in `Unitroller.sol`

### Summary

A flawed authorization check in the `_acceptAdmin()` function will prevent legitimate admin transfers and potentially allow unauthorized admin access, as the function checks if `msg.sender` is address(0) instead of validating if `pendingAdmin` is address(0), breaking the intended admin transfer flow.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/Unitroller.sol#L137-L138

### Root Cause

In `Numa/contracts/lending/Unitroller.sol#L137-L138` he admin acceptance authorization check is implemented incorrectly
```solidity
if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
    return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, FailureInfo.ACCEPT_ADMIN_PENDING_ADMIN_CHECK);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `_setPendingAdmin()` to assign a new `pendingAdmin`
2. `pendingAdmin` is set to a non-zero address

### External pre-conditions

The vulnerability is self-contained within the contract and does not require any external protocol conditions or state changes to be exploited.


### Attack Path

1. Admin initiates admin transfer by calling `_setPendingAdmin(newAdmin)`
2. `pendingAdmin` is set to `newAdmin` address
3. When legitimate `newAdmin` tries to call `_acceptAdmin()`:
   ```solidity
   // Given: msg.sender == pendingAdmin (legitimate call)
   if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
       return fail(Error.UNAUTHORIZED, ...);
   }
   ```
4. The check will always fail for the legitimate pending admin because:
   - First condition `msg.sender != pendingAdmin` is false (good)
   - Second condition `msg.sender == address(0)` is false (good)
   - But `msg.sender` is being checked instead of `pendingAdmin`
5. This breaks the admin transfer mechanism.


### Impact

The protocol's admin transfer functionality is broken, leading to:
1. Legitimate admin transfers being impossible to complete
2. Potential privilege escalation if combined with other contract vulnerabilities
3. Risk to core protocol security as this affects critical admin functions:
   - Implementation upgrades via `_setPendingImplementation()`
   - Admin transfers via `_setPendingAdmin()`
   - Any admin-protected functionality in the delegated implementation


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Replace the current condition:
```solidity
if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || msg.sender == address(0)) {
```
With:
```solidity
if (msg.sender != pendingAdmin || pendingAdmin == address(0)) {
```

2. Consider implementing explicit require statements for better error handling:
```solidity
require(pendingAdmin != address(0), "PendingAdmin cannot be zero address");
require(msg.sender == pendingAdmin, "Caller must be pendingAdmin");
```
