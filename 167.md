# Inflation Attack via Donations.

### Summary

`CToken` lacks a mechanism to prevent traditional inflation attacks through donations.

### Root Cause

The TVL calculation is based on the [getCashPrior()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CErc20.sol#L158) function, which relies on `balanceOf`. This creates a vulnerability to donation attacks.

```solidity
    function getCashPrior() internal view virtual override returns (uint) {
        EIP20Interface token = EIP20Interface(underlying);
158     return token.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```

This TVL calculation impacts the [exchange rate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L392-L397). Consequently, attackers can manipulate the exchange rate at will.

```solidity
    function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        ...
392         uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;

            return exchangeRate;
        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The `CToken` is initially empty, and Alice initiates a transaction to mint `CToken` with 1e18 underlying tokens.

Bob, the attacker, front-runs Alice:

1. Bob mints `CToken` with 1 underlying token:
    - `TVL`: 1
    - `totalSupply`: 1
    - `exchange rate`: 1
    - Bob's supply: 1
2. Bob donates 1e18 underlying tokens:
    - `TVL`: 1 + 1e18
    - `totalSupply`: 1
    - `exchange rate`: 1e18 + 1
3. Alice's transaction proceeds:
    - Alice receives: `1e18 / (1e18 + 1) = 0`
    - `TVL`: 1 + 2e18
    - `totalSupply`: 1

As a result, Bob can withdraw `(1 + 2e18)` with his 1 `CToken`, resulting in an unfair profit of `1e18` underlying tokens at Alice's expense.

### Impact

Attackers can steal funds from other users through inflation attacks.

### PoC

### Mitigation

It is recommended to burn dust `CToken` from the initial minter.
