# `NumaVault.updateVault()` extracts rewards before accruing interest, leading to unfair borrow interest paid

### Summary

In any lending protocol, all actions which affect the interest rate should be performed AFTER accruing interest so far. This is to ensure that interest is accrued fairly. 

For example, if the protocol was untouched for 1 day, and a user was hypothetically able to atomically max out the utilisation ratio before accruing interest for the 1 day, it would cause the borrowers to pay a much high interest rate for the entire day, which does not reflect the actual util ratio over that time period. This is why it's important to accrue interest BEFORE any actions that can change the util ratio / interest rate.

[`NumaVault.updateVault()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L533-L539) extracts rewards before accruing interest, leading to unfair borrow interest paid by LST borrowers.

### Root Cause

`NumaVault.updateVault()` extracts rewards before accruing interest, instead of accruing interest first.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users borrow LST

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Borrowing actions cause util ratio = 50%
2. Then, after a day, rewards are available to be extracted

**NumaVault.updateVault() is called**
3. First, it calls `extractRewardsNoRequire()`, which sends rewards to the `rwd_address`, increasing util ratio to 53%
4. Then, it calls `cLstToken.accrueInterest()`, which accrues interest for the one day, calculating the interest rate based on the util ratio of 53% (even though the borrows for the whole day were held at a util ratio of 50%).

Borrowers pay more interest unfairly.

### Impact

Borrowers pay more interest unfairly

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Re-arrange the function:
```diff
function updateVault() public {
+   // accrue interest
+   if (address(cLstToken) != address(0)) cLstToken.accrueInterest();

    // extract rewards if any
   extractRewardsNoRequire();

-   // accrue interest
-   if (address(cLstToken) != address(0)) cLstToken.accrueInterest();
}
```
