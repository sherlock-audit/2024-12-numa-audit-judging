# Missing validation in setSellFee() can cause sell_fee_withPID to never rebase

## Description
[setSellFee()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L257-L268) has the following validation missing. Owner **should not** be allowed to set `sell_fee` less than `sell_fee_minimum` and needs to be explicitly checked, else a situation could arise where rebase of `sell_fee_withPID` is stuck:
```diff
    function setSellFee(uint _fee) external onlyOwner {
        require(_fee <= 1 ether, "fee too high");
+       require(_fee > sell_fee_minimum, "fee too low");
        sell_fee = _fee;

        // careful
        // changing sell fee will reset sell_fee scaling
        sell_fee_withPID = sell_fee;
        lastBlockTime_sell_fee = block.timestamp;
        //sell_fee_update_blocknumber = block.number;

        emit SellFeeUpdated(_fee);
    }
```

## Impact
If `sell_fee` is set below `sell_fee_minimum`, the following can happen:
    - Assume `sell_fee_minimum = 0.5 ether` ([default value](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L53)).
    - Owner sets `sell_fee = 0.3 ether` due to the missing aforementioned check. The function [sets `sell_fee_withPID` too to `0.3 ether`](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L263).
    - Inside [getSellFeeScaling()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L401), `currentLiquidCF < cf_liquid_severe` and we need to enter the debase branch.
    - The [code takes care of clipping](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L420-L422) `lastSellFee` to `sell_fee_minimum`. This results in `sell_fee_withPID` to be updated to `0.5 ether`. The value of `sell_fee` is still at `0.3 ether`.
    - Next time if `currentLiquidCF >= cf_liquid_severe` and we need to rebase, the [conditional check here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L426) of `if (sell_fee_withPID < sell_fee)` is never satisfied and rebase never happens.

The only remedy now is for the owner to call `setSellFee()` again with a correct value of `_fee` so that it resets scaling.

From a financial standpoint, this means that users would be stuck getting less LST tokens than they should upon selling Numa.

## Mitigation 
```diff
    function setSellFee(uint _fee) external onlyOwner {
        require(_fee <= 1 ether, "fee too high");
+       require(_fee > sell_fee_minimum, "fee too low");
        sell_fee = _fee;

        // careful
        // changing sell fee will reset sell_fee scaling
        sell_fee_withPID = sell_fee;
        lastBlockTime_sell_fee = block.timestamp;
        //sell_fee_update_blocknumber = block.number;

        emit SellFeeUpdated(_fee);
    }
```
