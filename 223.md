# Repaying numa borrows is not possible during a pause

### Summary

## Summary
`Numa.sol` has a `beforeTokenTransfer` hook which has a `whenNotPaused` modifier
```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal override whenNotPaused {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```
This hook does not allow Numa to be transferred if the contract is paused. However users who have borrows in Numa and wish to repay them will be unable to despite interest still accruing even during a pause. Borrowers could suffer either paying higher interest or be unfairly liquidated if their position goes into shortfall/bad debt during the pause, not being able to fix their health. Malicious actors can scan the mempool and track users who are on the verge of going into shortfall during a pause, backrun the `unpause`, liquidating borrowers who did not even have an opportunity to repay their borrow.

It is an overall good practice to enable borrowers to repay their debt even during a paused state.

### Root Cause

- [`Numa.beforeTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L76-L81) has a `whenNotPaused` modifier

### Internal pre-conditions

- Protocol must be in a paused state


### External pre-conditions

none


### Attack Path

1. Protocol goes on pause
2. Borrowers who had sufficient collateral before the pause see that they will incur shortfall soon since interest continues accruing
3. Borrowers are unable to repay their debt due to `whenNotPaused` modifier
4. Malicious actors see this and backrun the `unpause`, liquidating the borrowers

### Impact

- unexpected behaviour
- missing functionality
- unfair liquidation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the hook
