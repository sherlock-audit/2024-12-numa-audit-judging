# NumaVault.sol borrowLeverage() only records last leverageDebt value

### Summary

`NumaVault.sol` `borrowLeverage()` only records last `_amount` in `leverageDebt`. If a malicious user calls `borrowLeverage()` multiple times, they only need to call `repayLeverage()` once and repay the last amount borrowed to have their `leverageDebt` reduced to 0.

### Root Cause

`NumaVault.sol` `borrowLeverage()`does not record down the cumulative `_amount` borrowed by a user.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A.

### External pre-conditions

N/A.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls `borrowLeverage()` multiple times.
2. Only the last call `_amount` to `borrowLeverage()` is recorded as `leverageDebt` in `NumaVault.sol` smart contract.
3. When the malicious user calls `repayLeverage()`, only the last recorded `leverageDebt` needs to be repaid for the `leverageDebt` to be cleared to 0.

### Impact

The attacker can gain an arbitrary amount of the underlying token in the `minterContract` without needing to repay them back.

```

From the output we see that first the deployer (which is the attacker in this case) has 8600000000000000001295249 Numa tokens.

They call `borrowLeverage()` twice and are minted 1 Numa token each time resulting in 8600000000000000001295251 Numa tokens.

They repay the last 1 Numa token minted using `repayLeverage()` reducing their `leverageDebt` to 0 but still have 8600000000000000001295250 Numa token which is 1 more than what they should have.

The attacker can call `borrowLeverage()` an arbitrary number of times to mint an arbitrary amount of Numa tokens to themselves.

### Mitigation

1. Set  a flag so that `borrowLeverage()` can't be called again until `repayLeverage()` is called.
2. Change in `borrowLeverage()` to record the cumulative `_amount` borrowed with:
```solidity
            leverageDebt += _amount;
```
