# Users are still charged a fee even if the fee recipient is `address(0)`

### Vulnerability Detail

Upon swapping between `nuAssets`, we have the following code:
```solidity
    function swapExactInput(
        ...
    ) ... {
         ...
        (uint256 assetAmount, uint amountInFee) = getNbOfNuAssetFromNuAsset(_nuAssetFrom, _nuAssetTo, _amountToSwap);

        ...
        uint amountToBurn = _amountToSwap;
        // fees are 100% sent
        if (fee_address != address(0)) {
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(IERC20(_nuAssetFrom), msg.sender, fee_address, amountInFee);
            amountToBurn -= amountInFee;
        }

        // burn asset from
        burnNuAssetFrom(nuAssetFrom, msg.sender, amountToBurn, 0);

       ...
    }
```
It calculates the `amountToBurn` from the user in exchange. Then, we send the fees to the fee recipient and deduct them from the `amountToBurn`. However, if the `fee_address` is `address(0)` indicating no fees, then this will result in `amountToBurn` not decreasing, causing the user to still get all of his tokens burned despite there being no fees.
### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users are still charged a fee even if recipient is `address(0)` causing loss of funds for them
### Mitigation

Decrease `amountToBurn` even if the fee recipient is `address(0)`
