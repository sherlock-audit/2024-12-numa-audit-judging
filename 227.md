# Selling Numa does not decrease `buy_fee_PID` correctly

### Summary

## Summary
Buying-selling Numa should increase-decrease fees and result in the original state, however that's not the case here.
## Description
The protocol team have designed their fees to move proportionally to the demand for Numa. Every time Numa is minted, fees increase, every time it's burnt - fees decrease. These dynamic fees are calculated in `VaultManager.updateBuyFeePID` which is invoked every time at the end of `buy` and `sell`. Let's have a look at `updateBuyFeePID`
```solidity
            uint _priceTWAP = printer.getTWAPPriceInEth(1 ether, twapPID);
            uint _vaultBuyPrice = numaToEth(1 ether, PriceType.BuyPrice);

            uint ethAmount = (_numaAmount * _vaultBuyPrice) / (1 ether);

            uint pctFromBuyPrice;
            if (_priceTWAP < _vaultBuyPrice) {
                //percentage down from buyPrice  in base 1000
                pctFromBuyPrice = 1000 - (1000 * _priceTWAP) / _vaultBuyPrice;
            }

            if ((pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy) {
                //_price is within incTriggerPct% of buyPrice, and is a vault buy
                uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_incAmt) / (1 ether);
                buy_fee_PID = buy_fee_PID + buyPID_adj; //increment buyPID

            }
```
The TWAP price is checked against the price of the vault, expressed in % difference through `pctFromBuyPrice`. In case the TWAP price is behind the vault one, `pctFromBuyPrice` is assigned non-null value and null value if the TWAP is more expensive. If the difference is within reasonable limits (in this case - 2%), a buy fee increase is triggered. If the TWAP price is lagging too much, there is no increase as the vault price is already considered expensive.

Let's have a look in a scenario where `_priceTWAP = _vaultBuyPrice`. In such instance, `pctFromBuyPrice` will always be 0 and the buy fee will always increase too.
User buys 100 Numa tokens, `updateBuyFeePID` is triggered and buy fee increases since `if ((pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy)` passes
User sells their 100 Numa tokens, `updateBuyFeePID` is triggered, however the following line comes 
```solidity
    (pctFromBuyPrice > buyPID_decTriggerPct) && (!_isVaultBuy) 
```
Since `pctFromBuyPrice = 0`, the check above does not pass and fee decrease does not trigger. We end up in the original state as if no new Numa was minted, however the buy fee is higher. Fees are expected to go up only when total supply has actually increased. This malfunction is even more detrimental when it comes to `feeWhitelisted` members buying-selling Numa - they pay no fees to the protocol but increase the state buy fee. 

### Root Cause

- In [`VaultManager.updateBuyFeePID`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L351), fees are not adjusted correctly in cases where the TWAP price and the vault price match

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, logic error

### Impact

- loss of funds for users
- inflated fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that buying-selling would result in the original state in terms of fees.
