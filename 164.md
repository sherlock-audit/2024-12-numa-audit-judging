# Inconsistent Fee Exemption for Whitelisted Spenders Between transfer and transferFrom Functions

### Summary

The fee logic is inconsistently applied in the _transfer and transferFrom functions of [NUMA.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L84). While the transferFrom function contains a condition to skip fees for whitelisted spenders (wlSpenders), the _transfer function does not have a similar check. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected fee deductions for whitelisted spenders when transactions are made directly using the transfer function.

### Root Cause

- The condition to skip fees for whitelisted spenders (wlSpenders) is implemented in transferFrom as:

`if ((!ns.wlSpenders[spender]) && (fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to]) {`

- However, _transfer does not have a similar check for whitelisted spenders.

- As a result, transactions using transfer (which directly calls _transfer) do not respect the whitelist logic, leading to inconsistent fee application.

### Internal pre-conditions

Setup:

- A spender address (spender) is whitelisted (ns.wlSpenders[spender] == true).
- The recipient (to) is flagged for fees (ns.isIncludedInFees[to] == true).
- A transaction is initiated using transfer instead of transferFrom.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Function Call:
- A user calls transfer(from, to, value) directly.

Execution in _transfer:

- The fee condition (fee > 0) && ns.isIncludedInFees[to] is checked.
- Since there is no whitelist check in _transfer, the fee is applied, even though the sender is a whitelisted spender.
- This results in a fee deduction, violating the expected behavior for whitelisted spenders.

### Impact

Inconsistent Fee Application: Whitelisted spenders are charged fees for transactions made via transfer, which contradicts the behavior of transferFrom.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, ensure that the wlSpenders whitelist check is applied consistently in both _transfer and transferFrom.
