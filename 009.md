# Buy fee changes incorrectly

### Vulnerability Detail

For every 1\$ of `NUMA`/`nuAsset` being minted/burned, the fee should increase/decrease. This can be confirmed by the docs:
> For every $1 of $NUMA minted via the vault, the buy fee increases by 0.0001%. 

Let's we take a look at the code implementation:
```solidity
uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_incAmt) / (1 ether);
```
`ethAmount` is the `NUMA` amount in ETH. This means that the buy fee is adjusting based on the ETH value instead of based on each 1\$.
### Attack Path

1. Buy fee is supposed to change 0.0001% for every 1\$ of `NUMA`
2. It instead changes on every ETH, if 1 ETH is 3000\$, then the fee would change 0.0001% instead of 0.3%
### Impact

Incorrect buy fee

### Mitigation

Adjust the fee based on the dollar value, not ETH value
