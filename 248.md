# User gets fewer Numa tokens when burning nuAsset tokens

### Summary

Incorrect calculation in [NumaPrinter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L448) results in user getting fewer Numa tokens when burning nuAsset tokens to mint Numa tokens

### Root Cause

In [NumaPrinter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L448), a wrong calculation is done to get the highest amount between the amount of Numa generated from the Vault buy price and the amount of Numa generated LP Price, and this results a lower amount of Numa returned to `burnAssetInputToNuma`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `burnAssetInputToNuma` when vault buy price != LP Price

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User  calls `burnAssetInputToNuma` when `vault buy price != LP Price`
2. `getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee`is called to fetch the max amount of Numa minted from burning ` _nuAssetAmount`
3. Higher amount of Numa between vault buy price amount`numaAmountVault` and LP price amount `numaAmountPrice` is returned 

### Impact

The user receives less `Numa` tokens than should be sent, when burning `nuAssetAmount` of `nuAsset` tokens.

_No response_

### Mitigation

[The line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L448)

```solidity
if (numaAmountVault < numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
```

should be changed to

```solidity
if (numaAmountVault > numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
```
