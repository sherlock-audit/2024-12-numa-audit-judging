# Vaults can be purposefully bricked by leaving small amounts of rETH

### Summary

## Summary
Any numa holder can sell their numa in any vault, regardless where the tokens came from, allowing Numa holders to have preferential vaults and brick smaller ones by leaving dust amounts of rETH.
## Description
Vaults have strict MIN and MAX deposit amounts which can be abused by leaving small amounts in it. One possible attack is a whale Numa holder to sell tokens in a smaller vault in order to cause the MAX deposit amount (10% of current lst balance) to be smaller than the MIN (1000 wei).
```solidity
        uint256 vaultsBalance = getVaultBalance();
        uint256 MAX = (max_percent * vaultsBalance) / BASE_1000; // @audit this can be below the constant MIN
        require(_inputAmount <= MAX, "must trade under max");
```
If a vault is left with balance of 9999 wei, MAX will always be smaller than MIN, causing a soft DoS. This attack is relevant even without bricking deposits entirely since a vault can be left with negligible amounts of liquidity and users will be allowed to MAX deposit only a fraction of that. For example:  

Vault holds 1 rETH (1e18 wei) currently valued at 3700 USD.  
Numa holder comes with their liquidity from another vault and burns it, leaving 0.0001 rETH (1e14 wei) or around 0.37 USD
Any further deposits to this vault can be at most a fraction of 0.37 USD, even if `max_percent = 1000`

Users won't be able to deposit a significant amount in this vault, effectively being pushed away from it or forced to interact with a bigger one. Large liquidity providers can collude and perform such attacks to increase their rewards and interest accrued in a preferential vault.

### Root Cause

- [`NumaVault.buy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L441) allows to only deposit, at most, a fraction of the current liquidity
- There are no checks in `NumaVault.sell` whether or not the burnt Numa was minted in the same vault

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Whale user mints large amounts of Numa in a big vault
2. User sells it in smaller vaults, leaving their liquidity at negligible values
3. Other protocol users can't make a significant deposit in the other vault so they opt for the bigger one
4. Whale user benefits from the extra liquidity/fees/rewards in the big vault

### Impact

- unexpected behaviour
- protocol can be gamed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track numa balances internally and allow users to sell tokens only from the vault that initially minted them. Additionally, add a boolean `max_percent_toggle` in the vault and perform a MAX deposit check only when it's on. This way in the scenario where the vault is left with 0.37 USD worth of rETH, admins can turn the `max_percent` check off in order to have the vault's liquidity restored before turning it on again.
