# The rewardRate is calculated in the notifyRewardAmount function, which could lead to a division by zero error if duration is set to zero.

### Summary

Please consider to add a check to ensure duration is greater than zero before performing division.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint _amount) external onlyOwner updateReward(address(0)) {
    require(duration > 0, "duration must be greater than zero");
    
    if (block.timestamp >= finishAt) {
        rewardRate = _amount / duration;
    } else {
        uint remainingRewards = (finishAt - block.timestamp) * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (_amount + remainingRewards) / duration;
    }

    require(rewardRate > 0, "reward rate = 0");
    require(
        rewardRate * duration <= rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this)),
        "reward amount > balance"
    );

    finishAt = block.timestamp + duration;
    updatedAt = block.timestamp;
}
```
