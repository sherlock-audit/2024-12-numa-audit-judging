# `buy_fee_PID`can be increased when TWAP price is equal to or below vault price

### Summary

In `VaultManager`, there is a mechanism to dynamically adjust buy fee based on real price and vault price. When vault price worths more, more fees would be applied to each buying offer to slightly decrease demand. However, in the current code, it's still possible to increase fee when vault price is below or equal to TWAP price.

### Root Cause

After each buy and selling offer, [`VaultManager::updateBuyFeePID`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L527) is called to adjust fees dynamically. In the function, there are a few branches to bring up or down the fee:
```solidity
            uint pctFromBuyPrice;
            if (_priceTWAP < _vaultBuyPrice) {
                //percentage down from buyPrice  in base 1000
                pctFromBuyPrice = 1000 - (1000 * _priceTWAP) / _vaultBuyPrice;
            }

            if ((pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy) {
                //_price is within incTriggerPct% of buyPrice, and is a vault buy
                uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_incAmt) / (1 ether);
                buy_fee_PID = buy_fee_PID + buyPID_adj; //increment buyPID

                if (buy_fee_PID > buyPIDXhrAgo) {
                    if (((buy_fee_PID - buyPIDXhrAgo) > buyPID_incMaxRate)) {
                        //does change exceed max rate over Xhrs?
                        buy_fee_PID = buyPIDXhrAgo + buyPID_incMaxRate; //cap to max rate over 4hrs
                    }
                }

                if (buy_fee < (buyFee_max + buy_fee_PID)) {
                    //buyFee above maximum allowable = clip
                    buy_fee_PID = buy_fee - buyFee_max;
                }
            } else if (
                (pctFromBuyPrice > buyPID_decTriggerPct) && (!_isVaultBuy)
            ) {
                //LP15minTWAP is below decTriggerPct% from buyPrice.

                // if pctFromBuyPrice is more than 2 x buyfee, we use our decrease multiplier
                uint basefee = 1 ether - buy_fee;
                uint buyPID_multTriggerPct = (2 * basefee * 1000) / 1 ether;
                uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_decAmt) / (1 ether);

                if (pctFromBuyPrice > buyPID_multTriggerPct) {
                    // do bigger reduction
                    buyPID_adj = buyPID_adj * buyPID_decMultiplier;
                }
                if (buyPID_adj < buy_fee_PID) {
                    buy_fee_PID -= buyPID_adj;
                } else {
                    buy_fee_PID = 0;
                }
            }
```

Vault price is determined by `numaToETH`, while TWAP price is determined by actual market oracle value. When vault price is greater, in order to protect against arbitrage actions, fees are increased slightly, this also brings down the demand on buying NUMA from vault. However, when vault price is less than TWAP price, or equals to, `_priceTWAP < _vaultBuyPrice` branch will not be reached, leading to `pctFromBuyPrice` being default value, as 0. And in a buy offer, `(pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy` would meet correct condition, and fees will be increased.

This means even when vault price is lower, fees would still be increased, additionally decreasing the demand on buy on vault.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `buyPID_incTriggerPct` is set to 2%, for example.

### External pre-conditions

1. Vault price is 90, TWAP price is 100.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Based on above scenario, since 90 < 100, so `pctFromBuyPrice` would be untouched and leave as default value 0. In a buying offer, fee increasing logic would be reached, and increases fee even when it shouldn't be. Making buyers pay more fees than intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change to:
```solidity
            if ((pctFromBuyPrice < buyPID_incTriggerPct) && _isVaultBuy && pctFromBuyPrice > 0) {
                //_price is within incTriggerPct% of buyPrice, and is a vault buy
                uint buyPID_adj = (ethAmount * buyPID_incAmt) / (1 ether);
                buy_fee_PID = buy_fee_PID + buyPID_adj; //increment buyPID

                if (buy_fee_PID > buyPIDXhrAgo) {
                    if (((buy_fee_PID - buyPIDXhrAgo) > buyPID_incMaxRate)) {
                        //does change exceed max rate over Xhrs?
                        buy_fee_PID = buyPIDXhrAgo + buyPID_incMaxRate; //cap to max rate over 4hrs
                    }
                }

                if (buy_fee < (buyFee_max + buy_fee_PID)) {
                    //buyFee above maximum allowable = clip
                    buy_fee_PID = buy_fee - buyFee_max;
                }
            }
```
