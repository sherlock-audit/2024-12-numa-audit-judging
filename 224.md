# Precision loss in debase mechanism

### Summary

When `currentCF` is less than `cf_severe`, the value of synthetics is debased. The debase rate is set at 2% over 24 hours and is determined by `debaseValue` and `deltaDebase`. The `ndebase` value is calculated as follows:

```solidity
// debase linearly
uint ndebase = ((blockTime - lastBlockTime) * debaseValue) /
    (deltaDebase);
```

However, since getSynthScaling is called very frequently, precision loss often causes the `ndebase` value to become zero in many cases. To address this, if `ndebase` evaluates to 0, the `lastBlockTime` is reset to its previous value, effectively not updating it:

```solidity
if (ndebase <= 0) {
// not enough time has passed to get some debase, so we reset our time reference
blockTime = lastBlockTime;
```

Due to the low precision of the `debaseValue`, debasing can only occur after a minimum interval of 1.2 hours (4320 seconds). If debasing is triggered before this interval, precision loss causes `ndebase` to evaluate to 0, resulting in no effective debasing.

This implementation fails when many large trades occur within the 1.2-hour span because the outdated debase value which is higher is used to make those trades. This can result in a significant decrease in the collateral factor without triggering the intended debasing mechanism.

### Root Cause

In [VaultManager.sol:514](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L514), using less precision for the debase value would cause debasing to occur only after a minimum of 1.2 hours.

### Attack Path

// Current Parameters
currentCF = 1400;
cf_severe = 1500;
syntheticsCurrentPID = 9000;
lastBlockTime = 1000 seconds;
currentBlockTime = 3000 seconds;

// ndebase calculation
ndebase = (5000 - 1000) * 20 / (24 hours) = 0

At this point, if users make trades, the debasing value of 9000 will still be used. However, the actual debase value should be lower than this.

### Impact

If huge amount of trades are done significant decrease in the collateral factor without triggering the intended debasing mechanism

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use higher precision for debase values in calculation
