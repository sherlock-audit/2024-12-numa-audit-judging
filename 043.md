# Incomplete Constructor Initialization for VaultV2Deployer Contract

### **Summary**:  
The missing initialization of state variables in the constructor will cause unexpected behavior for the contract users as the contract functions will attempt to use uninitialized addresses.

### **Root Cause**:  
In `vaultV2Deployer.sol:30`, the constructor parameters are not being assigned to their corresponding state variables.

### **Internal Pre-conditions**:
1. Admin needs to deploy the contract without initializing the state variables for addresses like `numa`, `lstAddress`, `pricefeed`, and `uptimefeed`.

### **External Pre-conditions**:
1. No external conditions required for this issue to manifest.

### **Attack Path**:
1. An attacker calls a function that depends on uninitialized addresses.
2. The contract functions fail or behave unexpectedly because the required addresses are not set.

### **Impact**:  
The affected party (contract users) suffer from unexpected contract behavior due to uninitialized addresses.

### **PoC**:  
[Numa/contracts/deployment/vaultV2Deployer.sol](https://github.com/arpitverma123/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/974d328f5cbe6a76e78f7d63ec6f8835155743f6/Numa/contracts/deployment/vaultV2Deployer.sol#L38)
```solidity
// vaultV2Deployer.sol:30
constructor(
    address _vaultFeeReceiver,
    address _vaultRwdReceiver,
    uint128 _lstHeartbeat,
    address _numaAddress,
    address _lstAddress,
    address _pricefeedAddress,
    address _uptimeAddress
) {
    vaultFeeReceiver = _vaultFeeReceiver;
    vaultRwdReceiver = _vaultRwdReceiver;
    lstHeartbeat = _lstHeartbeat;
}
```

### **Mitigation**:
Ensure constructor assigns parameters to their respective state variables to prevent uninitialized addresses.
