# Incorrect liquidation mechanics either causes revert on liquidation due to insufficient seizeTokens or causes transition into bad debt

## Summary
The protocol's liquidation mechanics are fundamentally flawed in two distinct ways that emerge when performing liquidations on positions. Either:

1. The protocol reverts on liquidation of remaining debt due to insufficient collateral to seize, **OR**

2. The position transitions into bad debt status after a partial liquidation, making the remaining debt unprofitable for liquidators and worsening protocol's health.

## Description
The protocol has two distinct broken liquidation paths that emerge when liquidating positions:

### Prerequisite
The borrower's LTV should have worsened enough such that if the entire debt were to be liquidated, there wouldn't be enough collateral cTokens to seize after adding the liquidation incentive on top. Or in other words the liquidator would encounter a revert with error `LIQUIDATE_SEIZE_TOO_MUCH` if he tried to liquidate the entire debt.

### Path 1: Insufficient `seizeTokens`--> ( _coded as `test_liquidationMechanics_path01`_ )
In this scenario:

1. Imagine that a position becomes liquidatable (has shortfall but not in badDebt). And the `borrowBalance` is above `minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation`.

2. A liquidator attempts a liquidation. This _will always be a partial liquidation_ due to one of these 3 reasons:
    a. The [closeFactorMantissa](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L104-L108) setting constraints that `repayAmount` is no more than 90% of the `borrowBalance`, even in the best of scenarios.
    b. Liquidator could choose a partial repayment based on their financial capacity.
    c. Liquidator could maliciously choose a partial repayment in order to carry out this attack.

3. The liquidator is awarded a [liquidationIncentive](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1487-L1511) (for e.g., 12%) and is able to seize those collateral cTokens from the borrower. 

4. Due to the above, every iteration of partial liquidation worsens the ratio of collateral cTokens to the remaining `borrowBalance` ( LTV increases with each iteration ).

5. Eventually a state is arrived where `borrowBalance` is below `minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation`. Now [only full liquidations are allowed](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1135-L1138) and hence every liquidation attempt [will revert with error](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L1020-L1024) `LIQUIDATE_SEIZE_TOO_MUCH`. Note that the debt is still not in the badDebt territory and hence `liquidateBadDebt()` can't be called yet which wouldn't have cared about awarding any `liquidationIncentive`.

### Path 2: Transition to Bad Debt--> ( _coded as `test_liquidationMechanics_path02`_ )
In the second scenario:

- Steps 1-4 same as above.

- Step 5: The worsening ratio with each partial liquidation iteration eventually pushes the debt into the badDebt territory where `borrowBalance` is greater than the remaining collateral. Although someone can call `liquidateBadDebt()`, it doesn't really offer any incentive to the liquidator. The protocol is already losing money at this point, even if someone cleans up the remaining borrowed balance.

## Impact
The impact is severe:
1. In Path 1, positions are left with debt that cannot be liquidated due to reverting transactions, leaving the protocol with unclearable bad positions
2. In Path 2, positions transition into bad debt and will now be closed at a loss. The protocol's health is worse than before.

## Proof of Concept
Add the 2 tests inside `Vault.t.sol` and run with `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=lite forge test --mt test_liquidationMechanics -vv` to see them pass:

## Mitigation 
Add the following 2 checks:

1. If a partial liquidation attempt would result in the debt going into badDebt territory, then it should not be allowed. Full liquidations should be allowed in such cases with a reduced liquidation incentive applicable. The code should allow `repayAmount = borrowBalance` and bypass the `closeFactorMantissa` constraint ( or set it temporarily to `1e18` ).

2. If a full liquidation attempt ( possible when `borrowBalance < minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation` ) would result in `seizeTokens` to be greater than the cToken collateral balance of the borrower, then the liquidator should still be allowed to go ahead and be awarded all the available cTokens in borrower's balance. 

This possibility of a reduced liquidation incentive should be properly documented so that liquidators know the risk in advance.
