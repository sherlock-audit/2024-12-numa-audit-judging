# Incorrect price types usage during conversions of `Numa` and `nuAsset` in `NumaPrinter`.

### Summary

The `NumaPrinter` uses the Numa `BuyPrice` when Numa gets burned (sold) and the `SellPrice` when Numa gets bought (minted).

### Root Cause

In `NumaPrinter` conversions of `Numa` and `nuAsset`s are happening. Users can either burn their Numa and mint nuAssets or they can burn the nuAssets and mint Numa tokens. For this to be achieved, the exchange rates between them are calculated using Uniswap and vaultManager formula for Numa pricing. We can see `NumaPrinter:: mintAssetFromNumaInput()` here :
```solidity
    function mintAssetFromNumaInput(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint _numaAmount,
        uint _minNuAssetAmount,
        address _recipient
    ) public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        require(address(oracle) != address(0), "oracle not set");
        require(numaPool != address(0), "uniswap pool not set");

        updateVaultAndInterest();

        uint256 assetAmount;
        uint256 numaFee;

        (assetAmount, numaFee) = getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma(_nuAsset, _numaAmount);

        require(assetAmount >= _minNuAssetAmount, "min amount");

        uint amountToBurn = _numaAmount;
        if (fee_address != address(0)) {
            uint amountToSend = (numaFee * printBurnAssetFeeSentBps) / 10000;
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20(address(numa)),
                msg.sender,
                fee_address,
                amountToSend
            );
            amountToBurn -= amountToSend;
        }

        // burn
        numa.burnFrom(msg.sender, amountToBurn);
        // mint token
        INuAsset nuAsset = INuAsset(_nuAsset);
        // mint token
        mintNuAsset(nuAsset, _recipient, assetAmount, _numaAmount);

        emit PrintFee(numaFee);
        return assetAmount;
    }
```

And the exchange rate calculation is happening in `NumaPrinter:: getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma()` :
```solidity
    function getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _numaAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        // print fee
        uint256 amountToBurn = computeFeeAmountIn(
            _numaAmount,
            printAssetFeeBps
        );

        // first convert this amount to Eth
        // formula is numaPrice = min(LPshort,LPlong,LPspot,vaultBuyPrice)
        // numa --> eth vault (buyprice)
        uint256 ethAmountVault = vaultManager.numaToEth(
            _numaAmount - amountToBurn,
@>            IVaultManager.PriceType.BuyPrice
        );

        // numa --> eth (pool lowest price)
        uint256 ethAmountPool = oracle.numaToEth(
            _numaAmount - amountToBurn,
            numaPool,
            tokenToEthConverter,
            INumaOracle.PriceType.LowestPrice
        );

        // compare
        uint ethAmount = ethAmountVault;
        if (ethAmountPool < ethAmountVault) ethAmount = ethAmountPool;

        // convert to nuAsset
        uint256 output = oracle.ethToNuAsset(_nuAsset, ethAmount);

        return (output, amountToBurn);
    }
```

However, as we can see in the highlighted part, for the conversion of Numa to ETH, the `BuyPrice` type is used. This is incorrect since the Numa is being **sold** / **burned** here. The same happens during the burn of nuAsset to Numa as well (there, `SellPrice` is used when technically the Numa is bought).

Let's see how the `numaToEth` are calculated in `VaultsManager` :
```solidity
    function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken(
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
@>            result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee();
        } else if (_t == PriceType.SellPrice) {
            (uint sellfee, , ) = getSellFeeScaling();
            result = (result * sellfee) / 1 ether;
        }
        return result;
    }
```

As we can see, when `BuyType` is used this means that the returned `ethAmount` will be **bigger** than the actual. In our case, means that it will be considerred as the burner of Numa will burn more numa (eat collateralization and create liabilities nuAssets) than the actual.

### Attack Path

Assuming `1e18 NUMA = 0.1e18 ETH` actual price in `VaultManager` and `1e18 NUMA = 0.11e18 ETH` in the oracle.

1. User is calling `NumaPrinter::mintAssetFromNumaInput` to burn 1e18 NUMA and mint an amount of nuBTC.
2. `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma` is triggered in order to calculate the fair amount of nuAssets to be minted but before that it tries to get the `eth value` that the user will burn. The oracle will return `0.11e18 ETH` while the vault manager will return `0.1e18 ETH / fee` which will inflate the eth amount and it will return lets say `0.106 ETH`.
3. The conversion is proceeding as the user is burning `0.106 ETH` in order to mint the nuBTC while he actually burns `0.1 ETH` and it must have been considerred as for example `0.97e18 ETH` since he is selling his NUMA. This is happening because user sells his NUMA at `BuyPrice` and not at `SellPrice`.

### Impact

Medium. Incorrect usage of `BuyPrice` and `SellPrice` when doing conversion between `NUMA` and `nuAsset`. The user gets more `nuAsset` that what it should when is burning NUMA for `nuAsset`, effectively creating more liabilities to the protocol.
