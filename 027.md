# Tokens can be transferred from a signed address to an unverified via the Numa contract

***Summary:***
Tokens can be transferred from a signed address to an unverified via the Numa contract. The unsigned user can call the transferFrom function in the Numa contract. And they can transfer funds from an address to their address. And they can specify any value they want. This can lead to theft of funds.

***Proof Of Concept (POC):***
1. A foundry test is set up.
2. The foundry test impersonates a user maliciously.
3. The transferFrom function is called.
4. The funds are drained from the smart contract app.

***Foundry Test:***
```ts
address malificent = address(0xfeefdeef);
vm.startPrank(malificent);
numa.transferFrom(from, to, value);
vm.stopPrank();
```

***Mitigation:***
Add a require statement that checks the from is the valid sender.
```diff
function transferFrom(
     address from,
     address to,
     uint256 value
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
+   require(msg.sender == from, "Wrong sender");
```
