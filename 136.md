# Missing payable Modifier in sell Function Prevents ETH Transfers to Users

### Summary

In the sell function sell in NumaVault.sol, users selling tokens do not receive ETH due to the absence of the payable modifier on the function. The contract is unable to transfer ETH directly to the _receiver address since the payable modifier is required for a function to send Ether. As a result, the intended ETH transfer fails silently, leaving users without the expected proceeds from their token sale.

### Root Cause

```javascript
   function sell(
        uint256 _numaAmount,
        uint256 _minTokenAmount,
        address _receiver
    ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint _tokenOut) {
        require(_numaAmount > MIN, "must trade over min");
        // CF will change so we need to update interest rates
        // Note that we call that function from vault and not vaultManager, because in multi vault case, we don't need to accrue interest on
        // other vaults as we use a "local CF"
        // rEth balance will change so we need to update debasing factors
        (
            ,
            uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee,
            uint fee
        ) = updateVaultAndUpdateDebasing();

        // execute sell
        // Total Eth to be sent
        uint256 tokenAmount = vaultManager.numaToToken(
            _numaAmount,
            last_lsttokenvalueWei,
            decimals,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
```
Here the function convert numa to Eth and sends it to reciever but lacks payable modifier
