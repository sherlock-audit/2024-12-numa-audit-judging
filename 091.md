# Users may end up paying higher than required fees during opening & closing of leveraged strategies

## Summary
[NumaLeverageVaultSwap::swap()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaLeverageVaultSwap.sol#L43) calculates buy/sell fees based on the estimated input amount rather than the actually used amount during token swaps. This leads to users paying higher fees than necessary when the actual amount needed for the swap is less than the initial estimate.

## Description
When a user initiates a leverage strategy through [CNumaToken::leverageStrategy()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L141), the protocol first estimates the amount of tokens needed for the swap (`borrowAmount`) to ensure getting the desired output amount (`_borrowAmount`) after accounting for slippage. This estimate calculated by `NumaLeverageVaultSwap::getAmountIn()` [is intentionally higher](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaLeverageVaultSwap.sol#L29-L36) than likely needed as a safety margin. This and other factors give rise to the following situation:

1. The protocol [estimates required input](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L193) (e.g., 31 rETH) to get desired output (e.g., 30 NUMA worth):
```js
uint borrowAmount = strat.getAmountIn(_borrowAmount, false);
```

2. This full estimated amount is [temporarily borrowed](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L198) to repay the vault:
```js
borrowInternalNoTransfer(borrowAmount, msg.sender);
```

3. The [swap is executed](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L208-L212):
```js
(uint collateralReceived, uint unUsedInput) = strat.swap(
    borrowAmount,
    _borrowAmount,
    false
);
```

4. `strat.swap` [internally called](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaLeverageVaultSwap.sol#L62-L63) `vault.buy()` which [called `buyNoMax()`](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L445). Fee was [calculated based on the output `numaAmount`](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L470-L493). This value `numaAmount` after deduction of fees was returned by the function, which got stored in the variable `collateralReceived` above.


5. `CNumaToken::leverageStrategy()` then continues and checks if `collateralReceived > _borrowAmount` and [returns excess amount to the borrower](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L221-L229) if true:
```js
        //refund if more collateral is received than needed
        if (collateralReceived > _borrowAmount) {
            // send back the surplus
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(underlyingCollateral),
                msg.sender,
                collateralReceived - _borrowAmount
            );
        }
```

As can be seen, while the excess `collateralReceived` itself is properly returned, the excess fees charged is not. User had to pay the fees even on the `collateralReceived - _borrowAmount` amount.

## Impact
Users pay higher fees than expected.

## Additional Impacted Area
The same issue also crops up when closing a leveraged strategy:
- **Leverage Closing**:
   - [closeLeverageStrategy()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L263) --> [closeLeverageAmount()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L243) --> `NumaLeverageVaultSwap::getAmountIn()` then `strat.swap()`

## Mitigation
Implement a fee refund mechanism that returns the excess fee after the `if (collateralReceived > _borrowAmount)` check.
