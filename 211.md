# synth scaling variable is subject to rounding twice when <`cf_critical`

### Summary

During times in which the `cf_critical` is bigger than the cf of 1.1, we are going to have a variable called `criticalDebaseFactor` that will be rounding two times.

First time will be [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L550) and second time [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L556-L558) - the reason is simple, we are using too little decimals (1e3) in calculating the value and it will round significantly.

Let's say that the `currentCF` is 1050.

In the first calculation this will be (1046 * 1000) / 1100 = `950.91`, but as we all know, the remainder will not remain.

In the second calculation (950 * 1000) / 1100 = `863.64` and again, the remainder will not remain as well.

In the calculation as well we've lost `0.64 + `0.91` = `1.55` which is ~0.15% of the total sum, well above the medium threshold.


### Root Cause

The root cause is the rounding in both calculations that stems from using 1e3 decimals only for the value, instead of a bigger decimal value such as 1e8.

### Internal pre-conditions

`currentCF` needs to be lower than `critical_cf`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users burn and mint so much that `cf_critical` is met and the mechanism for it is actived - synth scaling in critical mode
2. Alice decides to sell Numa to ETH via `NumaVault::sell()` and it runs through [vaultManager.numaToToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L582-L587) and as we see, it uses `_synthScaling` inside it to calculate the `synthValueInEth`, but due to the rounding issue, it will actually give the user more ETH due to the logic [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L681-L685) - the divisor is composed of the eth in balance minus `synthValueInEth` and `synthValueInEth` will be smaller than it should, thus giving the user more LST than he should've gotten given the smaller divisor in the calculation

### Impact

Users will get more LST when selling Numa and they will get less Numa when buying it via LST during periods when `cf_critical` is bigger than the `currentCF`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use values that have bigger decimals to minimize the rounding to a dust amount
