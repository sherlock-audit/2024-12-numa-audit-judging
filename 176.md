# `NumaOracle::numaToEth` and `NumaOracle::ethToNuma` calculate incorrectly the `ethAmount` out of the `numaAmount` inverting the `sqrtPriceX96` and `FixedPoint96.Q96`.

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The `NumaOracle::numaToEth` which is responsible for converting an amount of Numa to an amount of ETH is using the `NUMA/USDC` Uniswap V3 pool for this conversion and it "messes" it up with the conversion of `NUMA` to `USDC`. Let's the function :
```solidity
    function numaToEth(
        uint256 _numaAmount,
        address _numaPool,
        address _converter,
        PriceType _priceType
    ) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96;

        // ...

        uint256 numerator = (
            IUniswapV3Pool(_numaPool).token0() == token
                ? sqrtPriceX96
                : FixedPoint96.Q96
        );
        uint256 denominator = (
            numerator == sqrtPriceX96 ? FixedPoint96.Q96 : sqrtPriceX96
        );

        uint256 TokenPerNumaMulAmount;

        if (_priceType == PriceType.HighestPrice) {
            // we use numa highest price when burning nuassets to numa
            // in that case rounding should be in favor of the protocol so we round UP
            TokenPerNumaMulAmount = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
                FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(denominator, denominator, numerator),
                _numaAmount,
                numerator // numa decimals
            );
        } else {
            // we use numa lowest price when minting nuassets from numa
            // in that case rounding should be in favor of the protocol so we round DOWN
            TokenPerNumaMulAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(
                FullMath.mulDiv(denominator, denominator, numerator),
                _numaAmount,
                numerator // numa decimals
            );
        }

        uint256 ethForAmount = TokenPerNumaMulAmount;
        if (_converter != address(0)) {
            ethForAmount = INumaTokenToEthConverter(_converter)
                .convertTokenToEth(TokenPerNumaMulAmount);
        }

        return ethForAmount;
    }
```

We omitted the part where the `sqrtPriceX96` is retrieved since it has not to do with the incorrect conversion that is happening afterwards. In a `NUMA/USDC` Uniswap V3 pool as the [one](0x804aC8929612C34C9D218db133F18343D03618A1) that is deployed and holds around $200k liquidity the `NUMA` is `token0` and `USDC` is `token1`. When we call `slot0.sqrtPricex96` on that pool we get effectively the ratio of `USDC per 1 NUMA` but it is in square root and in very high precision so in order to get the actual ratio we have to follow this formula :

```md
actual ratio USDC for 1 NUMA = (sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96) / (2^96 * 2^96)
```
Simplified, for more info check [this](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/98685/computing-the-uniswap-v3-pair-price-from-q64-96-number)

As we can see the `nominator` is the `sqrtPriceX96` (which will be then multiplied by himself) and the denominator is `2^96`(which will then be multiplied by himself). If we see the actual implementation, this is performed and recognised correctly :

```solidity
        uint256 numerator = (
            IUniswapV3Pool(_numaPool).token0() == token
                ? sqrtPriceX96
                : FixedPoint96.Q96
        );
        uint256 denominator = (
            numerator == sqrtPriceX96 ? FixedPoint96.Q96 : sqrtPriceX96
        );

```

In our case, `numerator` will be `sqrtPriceX96` since `NUMA` is `token0` and the `denominator` will be `FixedPoint96.Q96`.

The problme occurs on the next line where this is happening :

```solidity
        if (_priceType == PriceType.HighestPrice) {
            // we use numa highest price when burning nuassets to numa
            // in that case rounding should be in favor of the protocol so we round UP
            TokenPerNumaMulAmount = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
@>                FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(denominator, denominator, numerator),
                _numaAmount,
@>                numerator // numa decimals
            );
        } else {
            // we use numa lowest price when minting nuassets from numa
            // in that case rounding should be in favor of the protocol so we round DOWN
            TokenPerNumaMulAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(
@>                FullMath.mulDiv(denominator, denominator, numerator),
                _numaAmount,
@>                numerator // numa decimals
            );
        }
```

The problem occurs in the highlighted parts where instead of doing `(sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96) / (2^96 * 2^96)` (which is the correct ratio, as described before) and then multiply by `numaAmount`, it is doing `(2^96 * 2^96) / (sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96)` and then multiply by `numaAmount`. Since `numerator = sqrtPriceX96` and `denominator = 2^96`. Of course, this is the inverse of what it should happen and it will **not** return the intended `numaAmount  * usdcForOneNUMA = usdcForNumaAmount`.

The same bug exist in both `NumaOracle::numaToEth` and `NumaOracle::ethToNuma`, but for simplicity above we will describe only the `NumaOracle::numaToEth`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Core function of `NumaOracle` which is responsible for the conversions in `NumaPrinter` of `nuAsset` and `Numa` will **not** execute the intended functionality and will not return the correct `ethAmount` out of the given `numaAmount`.

### Impact

High. `NumaOracle::numaToEth` is broke and doesn't actually return the correct `ethAmount` using the `TWAP` price of the Uniswap V3 Pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the correct formula as described in the report above.
