# Token approvals are vulnerable to front-running attacks

### Summary

The `approve()` function in `CToken.sol` and `Numa.sol` is vulnerable to front-running attacks. A malicious spender can front-run an approval change transaction to spend both the old allowance and the new allowance, potentially resulting in the loss of user tokens.

### Root Cause

In [CToken.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L175) and `Numa.sol` there are no functions to safely increase and decrease allowance

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice approves Bob to transfer 5 tokens
2. Alice decides to reduce this allowance to 3 tokens
3. Bob notices the allowance reduction tx in the mempool and frontruns it to spend the initial allowance of 5 tokens
4. Bob is granted a new allowance of 3 tokens, and spends it for a total of 8 tokens spent.

### Impact

Malicious spender can front-run approve and spend more than intended

### Mitigation

Add `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions to Numa and CToken
