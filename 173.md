# The `NumaVault.sell()` function can be reverted unreasonably due to improper balance check.

### Summary
There is a check for sufficient balance in the `NumaVault.sell()` function. However, the check is done with the amount including fees which is not actually sent.

### Root Cause
There is a check for sufficient balance in the `NumaVault.sell()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L589-L592
```solidity
        require(
            lstToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= tokenAmount,
            "not enough liquidity in vault"
        );
```

However, the amount used in the check includes the amount of fees which is not actually sent.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L328-L344
```solidity
@>  _tokenOut = (tokenAmount * fee) / 1 ether;
```

As you can see, only some part of fee is sent to `fee_address`, the remaining amount still remains in the vault.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L616-L619
```solidity
            uint feeTransferNum = fees * (1 ether - fee);
            uint feeTransferDen = uint(BASE_1000) * 1 ether;
@>          uint256 feeAmount = (feeTransferNum * tokenAmount) /
                (feeTransferDen);

            // clip sent fees
            uint256 feeAmountMax = (feesMaxAmountPct * tokenAmount) / BASE_1000;
            if (feeAmount > feeAmountMax) feeAmount = feeAmountMax;

            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(lstToken), fee_address, feeAmount);
```

This means that the `NumaVault.sell()` function can be reverted unreasonably even if there is enough `lstToken` in the vault.

### Internal pre-conditions
none

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
none

### Impact
The `NumaVault.sell()` function can be reverted unreasonably even if there is enough `lstToken` in the vault.

### PoC

### Mitigation
The check for sufficient balance of `lstToken` should be done with the actually sent amount.
