# Vault is vulnerable to inflation attack which can cause complete loss of user funds

### Summary

Attacker can attack the first depositors in the vault and can steal all users funds. this attack is also famously known has first deposit bug too. while doing this attack , there is no loss of attacker funds, but there is complete loss of user funds. he can complete this attack by front running and then backrunning , means sandwiching user funds. this problem takes place , due to improper use of exchange rate when total supply is 0.

here root cause is total cash in formula is being calculated with balanceOF(address(this)), which can donated direclty too. and price can be inflated

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

In this attack , attacker should be the first depositor,  and while deploying on ethereum, he can frontrun and can be the first depositor. 

### Attack Path

while depositing when , total supply of minting token is 0, attacker will deposit , 1 wei of asset and will be minted with 1 wei of share.

so now total supply would be 1 wei. 

now , he will wait for the first depositor , lets say first depsoit is 5e18 , and attacker will directly donates more than that amount , and now user tx would take place, but in result he will be minted with 0 shares , due to inflation in share price.

he can now, redeem his 1 wei of share, and in return he can get all amount of asset( donated+ 1 wei + user deposited)

in link we can see the formula which is being used for exchangerate.

### Impact

this can lead user loss of funds, and attacker will get benefited from this.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1000 wei ( some amount)  shares should be burned while first depositing. this is done by uniswap too
