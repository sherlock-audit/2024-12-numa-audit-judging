# closeFactorMantissa is not multiplied while handling max liquidations by liquidateLstBorrower() and liquidateNumaBorrower() when type(uint256).max is passed

## Summary
The protocol allows a liquidator to pass repay amount as `type(uint256).max` ([here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L986-L987) and [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1131-L1133)) so that they can liquidate the entire borrow balance but forgets to multiply it with the `closeFactorMantissa`, thus making it impossible to use this option and risking repeated revert of the liquidation attempt (due to front-running).

## Description
Liquidators who wish to avoid situations where their tx gets reverted because someone else (intentionally or unintentionally) front-ran and liquidated some amount before them (quite common) are allowed to pass `type(uint256).max` as the amount to liquidate and the protocol readjusts it to the current borrow balance. However since [closeFactorMantissa](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L104-L108) decides how much of the borrow balance can be closed in one go, their transaction will always revert if `closeFactorMantissa` has not been set to `1e18` (which it should not be, as the max allowed is `0.9e18`). To ensure tx is not reverted, the condition should take care of multiplying with `closeFactorMantissa`:

    1133:                  }
```

## Impact
Liquidators would find it extremely difficult to liquidate the max allowed amount and pocket the profits since they run the risk of a reverted tx if someone front runs them (specially on chains like Ethereum). They will have to be satisfied with choosing a lower amount thus limiting their profits.

## Mitigation 
Multiply with `closeFactorMantissa` as shown above.
