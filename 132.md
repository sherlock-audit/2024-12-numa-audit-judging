# Use of Stored Exchange Rates in Liquidation Calculations May Lead to Incorrect Seizure Amounts

### Summary

In the `NumaComptroller` contract, the `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` function calculates the number of collateral tokens to seize during liquidation using the `exchangeRateStored()` method. This method returns the stored exchange rate, which may not include the most recent interest accruals. Consequently, the calculation may be based on outdated data, leading to inaccurate seizure amounts. This inaccuracy can result in either the liquidator seizing too much collateral (unfair to the borrower) or too little (exposing the protocol to bad debt). The issue affects the fairness and accuracy of the liquidation process and could be exploited.

### Root Cause


The root cause lies in the use of the `exchangeRateStored()` function within the `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` method. The `exchangeRateStored()` function retrieves the exchange rate as of the last time it was updated, without accounting for any interest that has accrued since then. This means the exchange rate used in the calculation may be outdated. In contrast, `exchangeRateCurrent()` updates the exchange rate by accruing interest before returning it, ensuring the most accurate value is used.

    uint exchangeRateMantissa = CToken(cTokenCollateral)
        .exchangeRateStored(); // Note: reverts on error

    // Calculate seizeTokens using the possibly outdated exchangeRateMantissa
    // ...
}
```

### Attack Path


1. **Interest Accrual After Last Update:**
   - The collateral `CToken` accrues interest over time, increasing the exchange rate.
   - If no transactions have occurred to trigger `accrueInterest`, the stored exchange rate remains outdated.

2. **Liquidation Occurs Using Outdated Exchange Rate:**
   - A liquidator initiates a liquidation process.
   - The protocol calls `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens`, which uses `exchangeRateStored()`.

3. **Inaccurate Seizure Amount Calculation:**
   - The seizure calculation uses the outdated exchange rate, leading to an incorrect number of collateral tokens to seize.
   - This can result in either:
     - **Under-Seizing:** If the exchange rate increased due to accrued interest, less collateral is seized than appropriate.
     - **Over-Seizing:** If the exchange rate decreased (unlikely in most interest models), more collateral is seized than necessary.

4. **Potential Exploitation:**
   - A liquidator could time liquidations to seize more collateral.
   - Borrowers might avoid full liquidation due to underestimation of their collateral's value.

### Impact


- **Financial Discrepancies:** Incorrect collateral seizure amounts can lead to financial losses for either borrowers or liquidators.
- **Protocol Risk:** Under-seizing collateral may leave the protocol unable to cover bad debts if the borrower defaults.
- **Unfair Advantage:** Liquidators or borrowers could gain an unfair advantage by exploiting this discrepancy.

### PoC


1. **Setup:**

   - Assume a borrower has collateral in `cTokenCollateral` and a debt in `cTokenBorrowed`.
   - Over time, interest accrues on the collateral, increasing the exchange rate.
   - The `exchangeRateStored()` remains at the old rate since no interaction has occurred to trigger `accrueInterest`.

2. **Liquidation Attempt:**

   - A liquidator calls the `liquidateBorrow` function to liquidate the borrower's position.
   - Inside this function, `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` is called to determine how much collateral to seize.

3. **Use of Outdated Exchange Rate:**

   - `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` calls `exchangeRateStored()`:

     ```solidity
     uint exchangeRateMantissa = CToken(cTokenCollateral).exchangeRateStored();
     ```

   - This returns an outdated exchange rate that does not include recent interest accrual.

4. **Incorrect Seizure Calculation:**

   - The amount of collateral tokens to seize (`seizeTokens`) is calculated using the outdated `exchangeRateMantissa`.

     ```solidity
     // Calculation of seizeTokens using outdated exchangeRateMantissa
     seizeTokens = mul_ScalarTruncate(
         div_(
             mul_(Exp({mantissa: liquidationIncentiveMantissa}), Exp({mantissa: priceBorrowedMantissa})),
             mul_(Exp({mantissa: priceCollateralMantissa}), Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateMantissa}))
         ),
         actualRepayAmount
     );
     ```

   - This results in an inaccurate `seizeTokens` value.

5. **Consequences:**

   - If `exchangeRateMantissa` is lower than the current exchange rate, `seizeTokens` will be higher, causing the liquidator to seize more collateral than fair.
   - If it is higher, `seizeTokens` will be lower, potentially leaving the protocol under-collateralized.

### Mitigation


- **Use Updated Exchange Rates:**

  Replace `exchangeRateStored()` with `exchangeRateCurrent()` in the `liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens` function. This ensures that the exchange rate used in the calculation is up-to-date and includes all accrued interest.

  ```solidity
  function liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens(
      address cTokenBorrowed,
      address cTokenCollateral,
      uint actualRepayAmount
  ) external override returns (uint, uint) {
      // Accrue interest and get the current exchange rate
      uint exchangeRateMantissa = CToken(cTokenCollateral)
          .exchangeRateCurrent(); // Updates exchange rate to include accrued interest

      // Proceed with the calculation using the accurate exchange rate
      uint priceBorrowedMantissa = oracle.getUnderlyingPriceAsBorrowed(
          CNumaToken(cTokenBorrowed)
      );
      uint priceCollateralMantissa = oracle.getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral(
          CNumaToken(cTokenCollateral)
      );
      if (priceBorrowedMantissa == 0 || priceCollateralMantissa == 0) {
          return (uint(Error.PRICE_ERROR), 0);
      }

      uint seizeTokens;
      Exp memory numerator = mul_(
          Exp({mantissa: liquidationIncentiveMantissa}),
          Exp({mantissa: priceBorrowedMantissa})
      );
      Exp memory denominator = mul_(
          Exp({mantissa: priceCollateralMantissa}),
          Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateMantissa})
      );
      Exp memory ratio = div_(numerator, denominator);
      seizeTokens = mul_ScalarTruncate(ratio, actualRepayAmount);

      return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), seizeTokens);
  }
  ```
