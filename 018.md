# Debasing/rebasing periods can be decreased by 50% by a malicious actor

### Vulnerability Detail

Upon debasing, we have the following calculation:
```solidity
uint ndebase = ((blockTime - lastBlockTime) * debaseValue) / (deltaDebase);
```
If the time passed is less than 4320, we round down to 0 (`debaseValue is 20` and `deltaDebase` is 24 hours). However, there is the following check to handle such round downs:
```solidity
                if (ndebase <= 0) {
                    // not enough time has passed to get some debase, so we reset our time reference
                    blockTime = lastBlockTime;
                }
```
It resets the time to the last block time before the update. However, this can still be abused by a malicious actor by instead rounding to 1. It can also happen during normal conditions by users simply interacting with the protocol at certain times.
### Attack Path

1. Malicious user calls `VaultManager.getSynthScalingUpdate()` or any other block time state updating function every $4320 * 2 - 1$ seconds
2. The `ndebase` will equal $(4320 * 2 - 1) * 20 / 86400 = 1,9997685185$ which rounds down to 1
3. Instead of 2 debasing periods, there will only be 1 which causes the protocol to debase much slower than supposed to, which would keep the CF low and cause huge issues for the protocol
### Impact

Synthetics will derate slower than intended, which will keep the CF low as users are not incentivized to sell them
### Mitigation

Refactor the formula
