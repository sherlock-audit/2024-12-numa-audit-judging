# `NumaOracle::getNbOfNuAssetFromNuAsset()` contains wrong order of the two functions it invokes

### Summary

`NumaOracle::getNbOfNuAssetFromNuAsset()` is used to get the amount of one `nuAsset` converted into another `nuAsset`.

To do that correctly, we should get the amount of `nuAsset_first` and convert it into eth and then use that eth to see how much amount of `nuAsset_second` we are going to get, but the function does that wrongly.

The function currently takes the amountIn from the `nuAsset_second` and inputting the `nuAsset_first` as the address which basically takes the amount of the second `nuAsset` and converts eth to nuAsset even though we have NOT inputted any ETH into the function.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the incorrect order of the functions it calls. 

It should first `nuAManager.nuAssetToEth()` to correctly convert `nuAsset_first` and its amount to eth, and then call `nuAManager.ethToNuAsset()` with the eth received from the first function to get to `nuAsset_second` and its amount

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `swapExactInput()` to swap `nuAsset` to another `nuAsset` with specified amounts
2. Due to incorrect logic, user will waste gas due to a revert he didn't expect (the app will be on ETH mainnet), or the incorrect pricing may give the user much more value, giving the possibility of taking money `nuAsset` than intended.

### Impact

User will either lose money from gas fees (ETH mainnet) due to an unexpected revert and not being able to use the function, or drain the protocol due to returning an incorrect amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Swap the orders in which the functions are called, so they produce the correct value.
