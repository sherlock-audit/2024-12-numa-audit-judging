# rounding up while liquidating

### Summary

when liquidators liquidate a position the the seized collateral tokens in  NumaComptroller.sol is calculated as


        numerator = mul_(
            Exp({mantissa: liquidationIncentiveMantissa}),
            Exp({mantissa: priceBorrowedMantissa})
        );
        denominator = mul_(
            Exp({mantissa: priceCollateralMantissa}),
            Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateMantissa})
        );


        ratio = div_(numerator, denominator);
        seizeTokens = mul_ScalarTruncate(ratio, actualRepayAmount);
        return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), seizeTokens);
    }

seize collateral Is calculated as numerator = borrowtokens price x liquidator incentive mantissa
denominator = collateral token price x exchange rate mantissa

then the ratio of this is multiplied by repay amount

if borrow tokens price is more than collateral the ratio will be higher hence the liquidator will be able to seize more collateral tokens then the amount he repaid
and if exchange rate of this vault is lower, the liquidator will be able to seize more collateral (denominator will be smaller) than the repaid amount on top of that the borrow tokens price is always rounded up 

            return FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(1e18, 1e18, rEthPriceInNuma); // rounded up because we prefer borrowed to be worth a little bit more
        } else if (address(cToken) == vault.getcLstAddress()) {

again higher borrow token price = bigger numerator and higher ratio will result in more collateral seized then borrow repaid
one more thing to note here is that numavault applies a fee on collateral and borrow tokens borrow token fee is fixed whereas collateral tokens fee depends on the cf of numavault if its less the sell fee is more hence collateral will be worth less note collateral token is used in denominator hence lower the value of collateral higher the ratio and seized tokens for the liquidator


this is even without applying any liquidation incentive this is problematic for the protocol and will lead to multiple issues

after liquidations due to how seized tokens is calculated it is possible that after the repayment by the liquidator the seized tokens are significantly higher than the repaid loan amount hence a scenario can occur where there is no collateral left in the borrow position while borrow balance still not written off the protocol will have no way to write off these debts and since borrow amount accrue interest every block and the accrued interest are then added to total borrows which is directly used to calculate the exchange rate the higher the total borrows the more the exchange rate this will lead to the exchange rate being inflated while there is no real backing for that exchange rate the leftover balance will keep accruing interest every block which will lead to solvency issues for the protocol in the long term

### PoC

lets say alice has a borrow position with 1000 in collateral and 800 in borrow her borrow position is eligible for liquidation
bob a liquidator repays 790 borrow debt

collateralTokensPrice = 1e18
borrowTokensPrice = 1.2e18
trueCollateralValuation = 1e18 * (1 - 0.05) // After 5% fee
exchangeRate = 1e18
liquidationIncentive = 1e18
aliceCollateral = 1000e18
aliceBorrow = 800e18
debtRepayedByBob = 790e18

// Step 1: Calculate true collateral value after fee
trueCollateralValuation = 1e18 * (1 - 0.05)  // 0.95e18

// Step 2: Calculate the numerator (Liquidation incentive * Borrow token price)
numerator = 1e18 * 1.2e18  // 1.2e36

// Step 3: Calculate the denominator (True collateral valuation * Exchange rate)
denominator = 0.95e18 * 1e18  // 0.95e36

// Step 4: Calculate the ratio
ratio = numerator / denominator  // 1.263157894736842

// Step 5: Calculate seize tokens (Ratio * Repay amount)
seizeTokens = ratio * debtRepayedByBob  // 1.263157894736842 * 790e18 = 998.9473684210527e18

----> Final Result: Bob will seize approximately 998.947e18 collateral tokens

leaving 2 collateral tokens and 10 borrow amount which wont attract any liquidator to repay this debt after sometime the 10 borrowtokens will keep increasing in value because of interest leaving this debt in the contract note this is without considering any liquidationincentive

one more issue that will occurs from this is if a liquidator tries to liquidate a position fully the position will revert because it will try to seize more than the collateral balance

collateralTokensPrice = 1e18;
borrowTokensPrice = 1e18; //. equal to collateral price
trueCollateralValuation = 1e18 * (1 - 0.05); // After 5% fee
exchangeRate = 1e18;
liquidationIncentive = 1e18;
alice Collateral = 1000e18;
alice Borrow = 990e18;
debtRepayed By Bob = 990e18; ////full debt repayment

// Calculate the true collateral valuation after 5% fee
trueCollateralValuation = 1e18 * (1 - 0.05); // 0.95e18

// Calculate the numerator (liquidation incentive * borrow token price)
numerator = mul_(liquidationIncentive, borrowTokensPrice); // 1e18 * 1e18 = 1e36

// Calculate the denominator (true collateral valuation * exchange rate)
denominator = mul_(trueCollateralValuation, exchangeRate); // 0.95e18 * 1e18 = 0.95e36

// Calculate the ratio (numerator / denominator)
ratio = div_(numerator, denominator); // 1e36 / 0.95e36 = 1.052631578947368

// Calculate the amount of collateral to seize
seizeTokens = mul_ScalarTruncate(ratio, debtRepayedByBob); // 1.052631578947368 * 990e18 = 1041.578947368421e18

// Result: Bob will seize 1041.578947368421e18 collateral tokens which is more than the balance of borrower
causing a revert
