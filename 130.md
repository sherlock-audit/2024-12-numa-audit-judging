# Stale Borrow Balances Used in Liquidity Calculations Leading to Inaccurate Assessments

### Summary


The `NumaComptroller` contract utilizes the `getAccountSnapshot` function to retrieve a user's borrow balance during liquidity calculations. However, `getAccountSnapshot` returns the stored borrow balance, which does not account for the interest accrued since the last update. This outdated borrow balance leads to inaccurate liquidity assessments, causing the protocol to underestimate users' actual debts. As a result, users may appear more solvent than they are, enabling them to over-borrow and avoid liquidation, which can potentially lead to protocol insolvency due to undercollateralized positions.


### Root Cause

The core of the issue lies in the reliance on `getAccountSnapshot` within the liquidity calculation functions, such as `getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` and `getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal`. This function retrieves the borrow balance without including the accrued interest since the last interaction. Therefore, the protocol uses stale borrow balances for critical calculations, neglecting the accumulated interest that increases the user's debt over time.

```solidity
function getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal(
    address account,
    CNumaToken collateral,
    CNumaToken borrow
) internal view returns (Error, uint, uint, uint) {
    AccountLiquidityLocalVars memory vars; // Holds all our calculation results
    uint oErr;

    // ... (Collateral calculations)

    // Borrow calculations
    (
        oErr,
        vars.cTokenBalance,
        vars.borrowBalance,
        vars.exchangeRateMantissa
    ) = borrow.getAccountSnapshot(account);
    if (oErr != 0) {
        return (Error.SNAPSHOT_ERROR, 0, 0, 0);
    }

    // vars.borrowBalance does not include accrued interest
    vars.oraclePriceMantissaBorrowed = oracle.getUnderlyingPriceAsBorrowed(borrow);

    // ... (Further calculations)
}
```

### Attack Path


1. **Interest Accrual:** A user borrows assets from the protocol. Over time, interest accrues on the borrowed amount, increasing the user's actual debt.

2. **Stale Borrow Balance Retrieval:** When the protocol performs liquidity calculations (e.g., during additional borrow or redeem operations), it calls `getAccountSnapshot`, which returns the borrow balance without the accrued interest.

3. **Underestimated Debt:** The liquidity calculations use this outdated borrow balance, underestimating the user's actual debt.

4. **Overestimated Liquidity:** As a result, the user's liquidity appears higher than it truly is, allowing them to borrow more assets than permitted.

5. **Avoiding Liquidation:** In cases where the user's position should be liquidated due to undercollateralization, the protocol fails to do so because the calculations show sufficient liquidity.

### Impact


- **Excessive Borrowing:** Users can borrow more than their actual collateralization ratios allow, leading to systemic risk.

- **Avoidance of Liquidation:** Users who should be liquidated remain active, potentially exacerbating losses as their debt grows.

- **Financial Losses:** The protocol may suffer losses due to bad debt accumulation, impacting all stakeholders.

- **Protocol Insolvency:** If exploited broadly, the protocol could become insolvent, leading to loss of user funds and trust.

### PoC


1. **Setup:**

   - A user borrows 1,000 tokens of Asset X, which accrues interest at a rate of 5% per annum.
   - After a period (e.g., one year), the user's actual debt becomes 1,050 tokens due to interest accrual.
   
2. **Borrow Balance Retrieval:**

   - The user interacts with the protocol (e.g., attempts to borrow more or redeem collateral).
   - The protocol calls `getAccountSnapshot` to get the borrow balance.
   
   ```solidity
   (
       oErr,
       vars.cTokenBalance,
       vars.borrowBalance,
       vars.exchangeRateMantissa
   ) = borrow.getAccountSnapshot(account);
   ```
   
   - `vars.borrowBalance` returns 1,000 tokens, not including the accrued interest.

3. **Liquidity Calculation:**

   - The protocol calculates the user's liquidity using the stale borrow balance:
   
   ```solidity
   vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(
       vars.oraclePriceBorrowed,
       vars.borrowBalance, // Underestimated at 1,000 tokens
       vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects
   );
   ```
   
   - The user's actual debt is 1,050 tokens, but the protocol considers it as 1,000 tokens.

4. **Over-Borrowing:**

   - The user appears to have more liquidity than they actually do, enabling them to borrow additional assets or avoid liquidation.

5. **Consequences:**

   - The protocol underestimates the user's debt, allowing undercollateralized positions to persist.
   - Potential accumulation of bad debt if the user defaults.

### Mitigation

- **Update Borrow Balance Retrieval:**

  Replace the use of `getAccountSnapshot` when retrieving the borrow balance for liquidity calculations with a method that includes the accrued interest, such as `borrowBalanceStored` along with accrued interest.

- **Use Up-to-Date Borrow Balances:**

  Modify the liquidity calculation functions to call `borrowBalanceStored` and manually add the accrued interest, or directly use `borrowBalanceCurrent`, which updates and returns the current borrow balance including interest.

  **Suggested Code Changes:**

  ```solidity
  // Replace getAccountSnapshot with up-to-date borrow balance retrieval
  // Fetch the current borrow balance including accrued interest
  vars.borrowBalance = borrow.borrowBalanceStored(account);
  uint interestAccumulated = borrow.borrowInterestCurrent(account); // Function to compute accrued interest
  vars.borrowBalance = add_(vars.borrowBalance, interestAccumulated);
  ```
  
  If available, use `borrowBalanceCurrent`:

  ```solidity
  // Directly get the current borrow balance
  vars.borrowBalance = borrow.borrowBalanceCurrent(account);
  ```

- **Adjust Liquidity Calculations:**

  Ensure all liquidity calculations in the comptroller use the updated borrow balances:

  ```solidity
  vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects = mul_ScalarTruncateAddUInt(
      vars.oraclePriceBorrowed,
      vars.borrowBalance, // Now includes accrued interest
      vars.sumBorrowPlusEffects
  );
  ```
