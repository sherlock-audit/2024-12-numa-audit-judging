# borrowers can avoid being liquidated

### Summary

due to a check in numacomptroller the borrower can dos the liquidation and prevent liquidator from liquidating their borrow positions

        /* allow accounts to be liquidated if the market is deprecated */
        if (isDeprecated(CToken(cTokenBorrowed))) {
            require(
                borrowBalance >= repayAmount,
                "Can not repay more than the total borrow"
            );
        } else {



this ensures that the bliquidator didnt repay more than the borrow balance of borrower

            );
            if (repayAmount > maxClose) {
                return uint(Error.TOO_MUCH_REPAY);
            }


however a malicious borrower can exploit this by repaying very few 1 wei for example by frontrunning the liquidators transaction and decreasing his borrow debt the liquidation will revert due to this check after sometime no liquidator will be interested in liquidating this position
