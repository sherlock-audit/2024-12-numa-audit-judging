# Optimize fee logic is needed

### Summary

The _transferWithFee function could lead to situations where the transaction exceeds the block gas limit if the transaction amount is large, especially with high fees.
So it is needed to implement checks to ensure that large transfers do not inadvertently consume excessive gas.

```solidity
function _transferWithFee(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee
) internal virtual {
    uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 10000;
    require(amount >= amountToBurn, "Transfer amount too low");
    uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - amountToBurn;
    _burn(from, amountToBurn);
    super._transfer(from, to, amountAfterFee);
}
```
