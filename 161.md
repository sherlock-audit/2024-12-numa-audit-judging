# User will Received Less Amount Of Numa

### Summary

User will lose some Numa due to precision loss whenever user calls `NumaPrinter::burnAssetInputToNuma`.


### Root Cause

`BASE_1000` is being used in collateral factor calculation, criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, and criticalDebaseFactor within `VaultManager::getSynthScaling` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L550-L558

```solidity
function getSynthScaling() public view virtual returns (uint scaleSynthBurn, uint syntheticsCurrentPID, uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, uint blockTime)
    {
        _;
@>      uint criticalDebaseFactor = (currentCF * BASE_1000) / cf_critical;
        // when reaching CF_CRITICAL, we use that criticalDebaseFactor in numa price so that numa price is clipped by this lower limit
        criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee = criticalDebaseFactor;

        // we apply this multiplier on the factor for when it's used on synthetics burning price
@>      criticalDebaseFactor = (criticalDebaseFactor * BASE_1000) / criticalDebaseMult;

        if (criticalDebaseFactor < scaleSynthBurn)
            scaleSynthBurn = criticalDebaseFactor;
        _;
    }

```

`scaleSynthBurn` is being used to scale NUMA to be received based on the burned asset when user calls `NumaPrinter::burnAssetInputToNuma`. However due to precision loss, user will get less amount than the actual amount to be received.

Assuming the protocol state :

1. Eth balance of all vault = 2500000e18
2. Synth value in ETH = 2300000e18

| Variable                              | Code | Actual    |
| ------------------------------------- | ---- | --------- |
| Collateral Factor                     | 1086 | 1086,9565 |
| criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee   | 987  | 988,1422  |
| scaleSynthBurn (criticalDebaseFactor) | 897  | 898, 311  |

User calls `NumaPrinter::burnAssetInputToNuma` which then calculate the Numa received with `NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee`. However, user will get less `costWithoutFee` amount due to precision loss in scaleSynthBurn.

Assuming user try to deposit 500k worth of NUMA in nuAsset, due to low amount of precision user will get 655 less NUMA amount.

```solidity
    function getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _nuAssetAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        (uint scaleSynthBurn, , , ) = vaultManager.getSynthScaling();
        // apply scale
@>      costWithoutFee = (costWithoutFee * scaleSynthBurn) / BASE_1000;
        // burn fee
        uint256 amountToBurn = computeFeeAmountIn(
            costWithoutFee,
            burnAssetFeeBps
        );
        //uint256 amountToBurn = (_output * burnAssetFeeBps) / 10000;
        return (costWithoutFee - amountToBurn, amountToBurn);
    }
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

No Attack Required

### Impact

User will get less amount when they try to exchange NuAsset to NUMA.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing the precision to 1e18 or bigger than 1000.
