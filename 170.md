# Full repayment via the `CNumaToken.closeLeverageStrategy()` function is nearly impossible.

### Summary

In the `closeLeverageStrategy()` function, `_borrowToRepay` must not exceed `borrowAmountFull`. Here, `_borrowToRepay` represents the repayment amount, while `borrowAmountFull` is the total borrow amount.

For users to achieve a full repayment, they must set `_borrowToRepay` to be exactly equal to `borrowAmountFull`.

However, for ordinary users, this is nearly impossible. While they can view the exact value of `borrowAmountFull` through view functions, the transaction first calls the `accrueInterest()` function, which alters the full borrow amount. Additionally, the exact value of `borrowAmountFull` is scaled by 1e18, making it impossible for users to set the precise amount on the front end.

### Root Cause

As noted at [line 278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L278), the `closeLeverageStrategy()` function requires `_borrowToRepay` to not exceed `borrowAmountFull`.

Given this requirement, line 281 is effectively meaningless.

It would be more appropriate for users to set `_borrowToRepay` to a value greater than `borrowAmountFull`, allowing it to be adjusted in line 281 to match `borrowAmountFull`.

In fact, line 278 is unnecessary and should be removed.

```solidity
    function closeLeverageStrategy(
        CNumaToken _collateral,
        uint _borrowtorepay,
        uint _strategyIndex
    ) external {
        // AUDITV2FIX
        accrueInterest();
        _collateral.accrueInterest();

        ...

        uint borrowAmountFull = borrowBalanceStored(msg.sender);
278     require(borrowAmountFull >= _borrowtorepay, "no borrow");

        
281     if (_borrowtorepay > borrowAmountFull)
            _borrowtorepay = borrowAmountFull;

        ...
    }
```
