# Burning NUMA for nuAsset awards a buy fee to the user

### Summary

## Summary
Users are wrongfully assigned a buy fee when minting a nuAsset.
## Description
Let's have a look at the flow of burning numa for a nuAsset.
```solidity
    function getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _numaAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {

        uint256 amountToBurn = computeFeeAmountIn(
            _numaAmount,
            printAssetFeeBps
        );

        uint256 ethAmountVault = vaultManager.numaToEth(
            _numaAmount - amountToBurn,
            IVaultManager.PriceType.BuyPrice
        );
    }
```
The nuAsset amount is calculated by inputting how much numa users wish to spend, converting it to Eth and then from Eth to the nuAsset using it's pricefeed. However the conversion from numa to eth takes into consideration a buy fee which is in favour of the user.

```solidity
    function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken(
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
            result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee(); // @audit-issue user is assigned a buy fee
        }
        **SNIP**
        return result;
    }
```
By default `getBuyFee = 0.95e18`, so `result` will be effectivelly multiplied by 1 and divided by a number smaller than one, thus increasing it. The inflated output will be then passed to be converted from ETH to `nuAsset`

```solidity
        uint256 output = oracle.ethToNuAsset(_nuAsset, ethAmount); // @note ethAmount includes buyFee here
```
In cases where the buy fee reaches `buyFee_max = 0.7 ether`, users will be awarded 42.8% more nuAsset than what they should. Protocol can be drained by swapping numa-nuAsset-numa continously, ending up with more numa than what we started with which is afterwards redeemed for rETH in all vaults.

### Root Cause

- In [`NumaPrinter.getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L352-L355) uses a formula that awards users protocol buy fee

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Numa holder mints nuAsset through `NumaPrinter`, gets awarded a buy fee
2. They receive nuAsset worth more than the Numa they originally burnt
3. User burns the nuAsset to get even more Numa back
4. Repeat steps 1-3 
5. Redeem all rETH in all vaults

### Impact

- loss of funds
- drained protocol


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use conversion formulas that don't take into account fees.
