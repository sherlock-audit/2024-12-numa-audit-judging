# `NumaOracle.getV3SqrtPriceAvg()` does not round down for negative ticks

### Vulnerability Detail

In the function mentioned in the title, we have the following piece of code:
```solidity
(int56[] memory tickCumulatives, ) = IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool).observe(secondsAgo);

        // tick(imprecise as it's an integer) to sqrtPriceX96
        return TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(int24((tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int56(int32(_interval))));
```
This is problematic as we should be rounding down the result for negative tuck cumulative delta (if the result would be a floating number in "normal" maths).
### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect tick and thus, wrong price used in the protocol
### Mitigation

Round down for negative delta
