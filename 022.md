# No Fallback Function

### Summary

The absence of a fallback function means that the contract cannot handle unexpected Ether transfers, which could lead to loss of funds if Ether is sent to the contract.
I think it would be good to implement a fallback function that either rejects incoming Ether or handles it appropriately.
```solidity
    receive() external payable {
        revert("This contract does not accept Ether");
    }
```
