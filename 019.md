# Incorrect debasing percentage calculation causing a lower debase

### Vulnerability Detail

If the CF is in a critical state, the debasing factor should increase by another 10% to help being back the CF (quoting the docs):
>Further, the synthetics are debased an additional 10% beyond this rate

However, the percentage is incorrectly applied and instead the debase increases by ~9.09%.
### Attack Path

1. The debase factor is increased with this line:
```solidity
criticalDebaseFactor = (criticalDebaseFactor * BASE_1000) / criticalDebaseMult;
```
2. This results in $90 * 1000 / 1100 = 81,8181818182$ which is a 9.09091% decrease
### Impact

Incorrect debase which causes the CF to remain lower than intended

### Mitigation
```diff
+ criticalDebaseFactor = criticalDebaseFactor - (criticalDebaseFactor * 100 / 1000)
- criticalDebaseFactor = (criticalDebaseFactor * BASE_1000) / criticalDebaseMult;
```
