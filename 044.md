# Hardcoded Address for `vaultOldAddress`

### Summary

The hardcoded address for `vaultOldAddress` will cause deployment issues for the contract users as they will not be able to deploy in different environments where the address differs.


### Root Cause

In `vaultV2Deployer.sol:45`, the address `vaultOldAddress` is hardcoded instead of being passed as a parameter.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to deploy the contract with a fixed address for `vaultOldAddress`.


### External pre-conditions

1. No external conditions required for this issue to manifest.


### Attack Path

1. The contract is deployed with a hardcoded `vaultOldAddress`.
2. The contract cannot interact with the correct address if deployed in a different environment or address changes.

### Impact

The affected party (contract users) cannot deploy the contract correctly in different environments due to the hardcoded address.

```solidity
address vaultOldAddress = 0x8Fe15Da7485830f26c37Da8b3c233773EB0623D2; // Hardcoded address
```

### Mitigation

Replace the hardcoded address with a constructor parameter to allow dynamic address assignment during deployment.
