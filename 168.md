# Before transferring `CToken`, the `accrueInterest()` function should be called first.

### Summary

Before transferring `CToken`, the `NumaComptroller.transferAllowed()` function is called first to prevent any imbalance between the user's collateral and debt value.

However, since `accrueInterest()` is not called before `transferAllowed()`, the imbalance check is performed incorrectly, using outdated data.

As a result, legitimate transfers may be reverted, and illegitimate transfers could succeed.

### Root Cause

Before transferring `CToken`, the [transferTokens()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L149) function is invoked without first calling `accrueInterest()`.

Within the `transferTokens()` function, `transferAllowed()` is called.

The `NumaComptroller.transferAllowed()` function checks for potential imbalances between the user's collateral and debt value. However, this check is inaccurate, as it relies on outdated data because `accrueInterest()` has not been invoked.

As a result, legitimate transfers may be reverted, and illegitimate transfers could succeed.

The reversal of legitimate transfers is particularly concerning, as it can be time-sensitive, especially in liquidation situations for the receiver. And illegitimate transfers can lead to an imbalance between the sender's collateral and the value of their debt, potentially resulting in the sender facing liquidation after the transfer.

```solidity
    function transfer(
        address dst,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (bool) {
149     return transferTokens(msg.sender, msg.sender, dst, amount) == NO_ERROR;
    }

--------------------

    function transferTokens(
        address spender,
        address src,
        address dst,
        uint tokens
    ) internal returns (uint) {
        /* Fail if transfer not allowed */
90      uint allowed = comptroller.transferAllowed(
            address(this),
            src,
            dst,
            tokens
        );
        if (allowed != 0) {
            revert TransferComptrollerRejection(allowed);
        }

        ...
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Legitimate transfers may be reverted, and illegitimate transfers could succeed.

If the receiver is on the verge of liquidation, the reversal of legitimate transfers to this receiver becomes a time-sensitive issue.

And illegitimate transfers can lead to an imbalance between the sender's collateral and the value of their debt, potentially resulting in the sender facing liquidation after the transfer.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Invoke `accrueInterest()` before the transfer.
