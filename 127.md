# Dust borrowing amounts can cause the protocol to accrue bad debt.

### Summary

`NUMA `is designed for real-world assets and significant positions when Focuses on leveraged positions (2x, 5x, 10x) and Uses `rETH` as backing collateral. Users can potentially borrow dust amounts without proper collateral.

### Root Cause

As we can see that When dealing with very small amounts, the exchange rate calculation can round to zero, especially when converting between tokens with different decimals (rETH/NUMA).
```solidity
function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
    uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
    uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) / _totalSupply;
}
```
the issue occur of setting min Debt and min Borrow to low values causing protocol bad debt accumulation. We can see this in The `CToken.sol` implementation that allows borrowing without minimum thresholds:
[borrowFresh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L709)
```solidity
function borrowFresh(address payable borrower, uint borrowAmount) internal virtual {
    borrowFreshNoTransfer(borrower, borrowAmount);
    doTransferOut(borrower, borrowAmount);
}
```
also there is no minimum debt threshold in `borrowBalanceStoredInternal` 
Setting these to low values will allow positions to be created with low debts and liquidations won't happen on small positions due to it not generating enough profit to cover the costs of the liquidator ( as much as we can tell that liquidation profitability is a key factor).This will cause the protocol to accrue bad debt.

### Impact

Protocol accumulates uncollateralized dust loans wich make Each position is too small for profitable liquidation. This make the Protocol can accrue bad debt.
