# users can frontrun withdraw reserves and make a huge profit

### Summary

A malicious user could monitor the mempool for withdrawReserves calls and then execute a sandwich attack. First, they would call userDeposit before the withdrawReserves transaction, and then execute a userWithdraw call immediately after. By using a tool like Flashbots, they can take advantage of changes in exchange rates and make an instant profit from this manipulation.

When a user deposits or withdraws from the vault, the exchange rate between the token and its corresponding token is calculated. this exchange rate is determined as 

            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;


            return exchangeRate;


reserve is withdrawble by the priotocol as we can see here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L1503-L1542

when owner will call _reduceReserves the exchange rate will increase as the numerator will also increase this will increase the exchange rate. which can be exploited by malicious user to make profit by watching the mempool

### Internal pre-conditions

admin reduces reserves

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. admin calls reduce reserves
2. malicious user front runs the transaction and deposits in the contract
3. reserves are withdrawn
4. malicious user backruns and exploits the increased exchange rate

### Impact

The withdrawnReserves action triggers an immediate rise in the exchange rate, opening up an arbitrage opportunity. Malicious actors can exploit this by performing a sandwich attack

### PoC
scenario 1
totalCash = 20000
totalBorrows = 10000
totalSupply = 30000
expScale = 1e18
reserves = 5000
For Reserves = 5000:
    Exchange Rate = ((20000 + 10000 - 5000) * 1e18) / 30000
                  = (25000 * 1e18) / 30000
                  = 833333333333333333 
     Exchange Rate = 0.8333

now admin calls reduce reserves and withdraws 4000 from reserves
scenario 2
For Reserves = 1000 (after 4000 withdrawal)
    Exchange Rate = ((20000 + 10000 - 1000) * 1e18) / 30000
                  = (29000 * 1e18) / 30000
                  = 966666666666666667 
    Decimal Exchange Rate = 0.9667
the exchange rate is increased which opens a window for a malicious users

### Mitigation

remove the reserves from exchange rate calculation
