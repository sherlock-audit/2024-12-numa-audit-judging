# User can withdraw all collateral when a position has enough profit leaving no assets for liquidation if positions later become unhealthy.

### Summary

In Ctoken [redeemfresh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L608) , the protocol checks if withdrawal is allowed through `comptroller.redeemAllowed()` which only verifies the current position health.

### Root Cause

Let's assume, If a user's position has sufficient profit due to favorable price movements of their collateral asset (i.e. collateral value has increased enough relative to their borrow), they can withdraw all their collateral tokens. When the position later becomes `liquidatable `due to price movements, there is no collateral remaining in the position for liquidators to seize, making the liquidation mechanism ineffective.

The key check in` redeemFresh` is point-in-time and does not account for future price volatility:
```solidity
uint allowed = comptroller.redeemAllowed(address(this), redeemer, redeemTokens);
if (allowed != 0) {
    revert RedeemComptrollerRejection(allowed);
}
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Users can execute this through the following steps:

1. User deposits collateral and receives `cTokens`:

```solidity
// User deposits underlying asset (eg ETH) using CToken.sol
mintInternal(depositAmount); // Converts ETH to cTokens
// User now has cTokens representing their collateral

// User then borrows against this collateral
borrowInternal(borrowAmount); // Gets borrowed assets
```

2. Position Management:
```solidity
// CToken tracks user's position through:
accountTokens[user] // Collateral balance
accountBorrows[user] // Borrow balance

// Exchange rate between underlying and cTokens:
exchangeRateStoredInternal() // Used to calculate real value
```

3. When position becomes profitable due to price increases, user can withdraw all collateral via:
```solidity
// Value calculation in NumaComptroller
// collateralValue = cTokenBalance * exchangeRate * price
// borrowValue = borrowBalance * price
```
Withdrawal Execution:
```solidity
// User calls redeemInternal() which triggers:
redeemFresh(msg.sender, redeemTokens, 0);
// Checks only current position health through:
comptroller.redeemAllowed(address(this), redeemer, redeemTokens)
```
We can tell that users first get `cTokens `for their collateral , then can borrow against it, and finally can withdraw during profitable periods using redeem().

### Impact

Users can extract all collateral during profitable periods wich make the Protocol loses ability to liquidate positions if they later become unhealthy so indeed Creates  an uncollateralized debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


A minimum amount of collateral should always remain in the user account as long as he has got open positions.
