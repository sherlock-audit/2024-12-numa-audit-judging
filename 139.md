# `updateBuyFeePID` Function is Exposes the Protocol to DOS Attacks

### Summary

In the VaultManager.sol contract, the updateBuyFeePID function at line 298 is declared as external, allowing it to be called by any user. This exposes the protocol to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, where malicious actors can repeatedly call the function, forcing unnecessary computations and updates, potentially congesting the protocol's operations.

### Root Cause

```javascript
function updateBuyFeePID(uint _numaAmount, bool _isVaultBuy) external {
        if (_numaAmount == 0) {
            return;
        }

        uint currentBlockts = block.timestamp;
        if (nextCheckBlock == 0) {
            nextCheckBlock = currentBlockts + nextCheckBlockWindowDelta;
        }
        // when delta time is reached or PID is below last reference we reset reference
        else if (currentBlockts > nextCheckBlock) {
            //reset the increment max rate params
            buyPIDXhrAgo = buy_fee_PID;
            //set new block height +xhrs from now
            nextCheckBlock = currentBlockts + nextCheckBlockWindowDelta;
        }
```
