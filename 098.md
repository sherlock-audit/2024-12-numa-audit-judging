# The max vault buy can be exceeded

### Summary

The oracle used for NUMA collateral/debt pricing is not a traditional chainlink styled oracle. It uses the vault buy/sell price to determine the value of NUMA. The issue with this is that it is atomically manipulatable. 

The protocol aims to limit the price manipulatability via a maximum vault buy, set to 10% of the vault's balance + debt. 

However these maximum vault buys can be repeated many times, buying large amounts of NUMA and raising the price. This allows NUMA borrows to be liquidated, and the attacker can profit via the liquidator bonus.

### Root Cause

Collateral/debt oracle is manipulatable, and the max vault buy is not enforced sufficiently. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker uses an external flash loan to borrow rETH
2. Attacker repeatedly buys the maximum amount of NUMA, raising it's price (as long as synth value != 0)
3. Now that NUMA is more expensive, NUMA borrows can be liquidated, and the attacker can profit via the liquidation bonus

### Impact

Liquidations can be triggered atomically via price manipulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a 'max buy per block'. This ensures that repeated buys in the same transaction can't exceed 10% of the vault's balance+debt.
