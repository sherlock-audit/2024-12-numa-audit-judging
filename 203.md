# Redeeming `lstToken` from vault incorrectly checks vault balance before applying a sell fee

### Summary

## Summary
Selling Numa for LST in a vault checks fund availability before applying a sell fee. Last person to withdraw won't be able to fully retrieve their funds.
## Description
Let's observe the `sell` method in vault and how it performs checks for sufficient liquidity
```solidity
        uint256 tokenAmount = vaultManager.numaToToken(
            _numaAmount,
            last_lsttokenvalueWei,
            decimals,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        require(tokenAmount > 0, "amount of token is <=0");
        require(
            lstToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= tokenAmount, // @audit checks availability before applying fees below
            "not enough liquidity in vault"
        );


        if (feeWhitelisted[msg.sender]) {
            fee = 1 ether;
        }
        _tokenOut = (tokenAmount * fee) / 1 ether;            
```
We see the following flow:
1. Input numa amount is converted to lst tokens 
2. A sanity check is performed to see whether the contract has sufficient balance to cover `tokenAmount`
3. A fee is applied on `tokenAmount` 

This order of execution is incorrect as it disallows a user to entirely pull out the remaining funds in a vault when they have sufficient balance to do so.
Assume that the user has 100$ worth of tokens, knows there is a 10% sell fee and there are 90$ worth of tokens in the vault. User should be able to request to retrieve his 100$ tokens, pay a 10$ fee and get the remaining balance in the vault. However the require check will fail due to checking the current balance against an amount which is not yet taxed with a fee.

User would be able to request multiple transactions to retrieve most of the balance they are entitled to, however a full withdrawal will never be possible. Last person to withdraw from a vault won't be able to fully retrieve what they are owed. 

### Root Cause

- In [`NumaVault.sell`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L589-L592), available liquidity is incorrectly checked against a pre-tax amount

### Internal pre-conditions

- Last user to withdraw from a vault wants to retrieve their funds

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. User has 100 tokens, fee is 10%, vault has 90 tokens, user should be able to withdraw all of it 
2. User attempts to withdraw their entire balance which will cause a revert


### Impact

- logic error
- partial loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform the balance check against `_tokenOut` instead of `tokenAmount`
