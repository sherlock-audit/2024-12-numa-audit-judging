# borrowRateMaxMantissa is incorrectly configured for Arbitrum mainnet, enabling absurdly high borrow rates

### Summary

The `borrowRateMaxMantissa` constant variable’s value has been taken from Compound, but not updated to work on other chains (Arbitrum, Base), allowing for incorrectly high borrow rates.

### Root Cause

`borrowRateMaxMantissa` in `CTokenStorage` is a constant variable that is set to prevent interest rates from being absurdly high.

During interest accrual:

```solidity
require(
    borrowRateMantissa <= borrowRateMaxMantissa,
    "borrow rate is absurdly high"
);
```

It represents the maximum borrow rate per block. It’s currently [hardcoded](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CTokenInterfaces.sol#L30-L31) to 0.0005e16, but this is only valid for ETH mainnet’s block time (forked from Compound).

Since Numa protocol will be deployed on Arbitrum, with an average block time of 0.25s, this rate of 0.0005e16 per block corresponds to a much higher APY than it does on ETH mainnet.

On ETH, with a block time of 12s, the max borrow APR is `0.0005% * (365 * 24 * 3600)/12 = 1314%` 

However on Arbitrum, with a block time of 0.25s, the max borrow APR is `0.0005% * (365 * 24 * 3600) / 0.25 = 63072%`

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The max borrow rate is absurdly high and this is not prevented, as it should be.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set `borrowRateMaxMantissa` based on the chain id, or have a setter function for it.
