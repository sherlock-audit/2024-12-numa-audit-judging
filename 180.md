# Lending lst tokens will be almost impossible in case of multiple vaults

### Summary

Borrowing is only allowed when the ETH value in the vaults is 200% greater than the value of the synths, as determined by `cf_liquid_warning`

```solidity
function getMaxBorrow() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint synthValueInEth = vaultManager.getTotalSynthValueEth();

        // single vault balance
        uint EthBalance = getEthBalanceNoDebt();

        uint synthValueWithCF = FullMath.mulDiv(
            synthValueInEth,
            cf_liquid_warning,
            BASE_1000
        );
        if (EthBalance < synthValueWithCF) return 0;
        ...
    }
```

The `getMaxBorrow` function incorrectly calculates the maximum borrowable amount. It uses the value of a single vault instead of considering the combined value across all vaults. This means that if anyone tries to borrow from a vault, the ETH value in that specific vault must be 200% greater than the total value of the synths

In the case of multiple vaults, synths are minted and backed by the combined collateral across all the vaults. As a result, it is highly unlikely for a single vault to hold such a large value. Consequently, in most cases, borrowing is not possible, even if there is sufficient collateral available to borrow

### Root Cause

In [NumaVault.sol:741](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L741), the maximum borrow amount is calculated using the ETH value of the specific vault, rather than considering the combined ETH value across all vaults.

### Attack Path

1. Letâ€™s say there are 4 vaults deployed with the following ETH value:

   - Vault 1: 30 ETH  
   - Vault 2: 50 ETH  
   - Vault 3: 70 ETH  
   - Vault 4: 50 ETH  

2. Total ETH balance across all vaults: 30 + 50 + 70 + 50 = **200 ETH**.  
3. Synths value (`synthValueInEth`): **50 ETH**.  
4. Synths value with collateralization factor (`SynthsValueWithCF`): **200% of 50 ETH = 100 ETH**.  
5. **If the borrow request is made from Vault 1**:  
   - ETH balance: 30 ETH.  
   - Required ETH for borrowing (200% of 50 ETH): 100 ETH.  
   - Max borrow will be 0

6. **If the borrow request is made from Vault 2**:  
   - ETH balance: 50 ETH.  
   - Required ETH: 100 ETH.  
   - Max borrow will be 0

Similarly, for Vaults 3 and 4, borrowing is also **not allowed** because no single vault has 100 ETH.


### Impact

Borrowing is not possible, even if there is sufficient collateral available to borrow

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the total ETH value across all vaults when checking the collateral requirement. Additionally, ensure that a certain amount of collateral always remains in each vault, which cannot be borrowed.
