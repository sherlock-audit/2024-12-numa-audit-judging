# Unable To Mint Synthetics

### Summary

Minting synthetics will be prohibited even though the collateral factor isn't below cf_warning.


### Root Cause

README :

> When globalCF ((total eth balance + debts) / (total synth value en Eth)) is < cf_warning we forbid minting synthetics

Based on above statement where if `(total eth / total synth) < cf_warning` the contract will forbid minting synthetics. We can see this requirement being implemented by `notInWarningCF` modifier in `NumaPrinter::mintNuAsset` function. However the problem relies on the conditional checks where the `currentCF` must be greater than ` vaultManager.getWarningCF()`

Assuming the protocol state :

1. Eth balance = 170,000e18
2. Synth value in ETH = 100,000e18;
3. Collateral Factor = 1700

Based on the result above, this condition violates the README where if `((total eth balance + debts) / (total synth value en Eth)) is < cf_warning` the synthetics minting will be forbidden. Because in reality, if the `currentCF == vaultManager.getWarningCF()` the synthetics minting will also be forbidden, this could get worse when the protocol grows even bigger due to the low precision value which is 1000, where if there is 1,7m ETh and 1m synth value, the disperancy value is 1000 ETH.

        uint currentCF = vaultManager.getGlobalCF();
-       require(currentCF > vaultManager.getWarningCF(), "minting forbidden");
+       require(currentCF >= vaultManager.getWarningCF(), "minting forbidden");
        _;
