# Incorrect modifier disallows swapping `nuAssets`

### Vulnerability Detail

Upon minting and swapping `nuAssets`, we have the following modifier which disallows the aforementioned actions:
```solidity
modifier notInWarningCF() {
    ...
}
```
The issue is that the modifier should not actually be applied when swapping as this doesn't decrease the CF.
### Attack Path

1. User tries to mint `nuAssets` when the CF is in a warning state
2. As the `CF` will decrease, this correctly reverts (due to the `nuAsset` supply increasing while the `rETH` balance staying stationary)
3. User wants to swap between `nuAssets` when the CF is in a warning state
4. This will incorrectly revert despite the user not worsening the CF and even improving it (due to round downs)
### Impact

Swapping is impossible when the CF is in a warning state even though it shouldn't be

### Mitigation

Remove the modifier from the swapping functions
