# Attacker can user any malicious contract as a collateral to steal funds or influence the protocol state

### Summary

`CNumaToken.sol:leverageStrategy()` and `CNumaToken.sol:closeLeverageStrategy()` both have an input field `CNumaToken _collateral`. The problem arises because the `_collateral` is not checked, nor whitelisted. Therefore the attacker can create its own `_collateral` contract, with overridden or newly implemented functions. The `_collateral` can be anything the attacker implements, as long as the names of function or functions in `CNumaToken` are the same as in the attacker’s implemented malicious `_collateral`. Therefore the attacker can create specific malicious collateral to steal Numa funds or influence the protocol state.

The ability for attackers to play with the implementation of `_collateral` opens a lot of possibilities for attacks. We won’t cover all possible attacks, because the possibilities are huge. Throughout the report, we would only give a simple example to illustrate the issue, and give the foundry code to prove the `CNumaToken _collateral` does not need to be a `CNumaToken` implementation and really can be anything the attacker implements, as long as the names of the function or functions are the same.

### Example of an Attack

If we take a look at `CNumaToken.sol:172-176` :

```solidity
    EIP20Interface(underlyingCollateral).approve(
        address(_collateral),
        totalAmount
    );
    _collateral.mint(totalAmount);

```

We can see the potential vulnerable code the attacker can exploit with malicious `_collateral` to steal `underlyingCollateral`. 

For a specific code part of the code, the malicious `_collateral` the attacker can use, can be for example a malicious erc20.
Here is a pseudo code for the example we mentioned:

```solidity
contract MaliciousERC20 is ERC20 {

    address public underlying;

    constructor(address _underlying) ERC20("MaliciousToken", "MT") {
        underlying = _udnerlying;
    }

    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external {
        IERC20(underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), IERC20(underlying).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)));
        _mint(account, amount);
    }
}
```

In the pseudo code, the attacker can implement a `mint` function that transfers all allowed tokens to itself and then mints the malicious tokens for the `CNumaToken.sol:leverageStrategy()``.

This is just an example of how attacker can think about the attack and stealing, the real world scenario and how the state of the protocol will look is hard to predict.
Therefore we wanted to just give the example of how the attacker can think about an exploit to illustrate the issue. 

### Proof of Concept

Although it would be nice to prove the concept with Numa tests and Numa functions, it was hard for us to run Numa tests. 
Therefore we will make a simple example in foundry to illustrate that the `CNumaToken _collateral` does not need to be a `CNumaToken` implementation and really can be anything the attacker implements, as long as the names of the function or functions are the same.

Here is the foundry code to prove the concept:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

// Example of NumaToken contract
contract NumaToken {
    function decimals() external pure returns (uint256) {
        return 18;
    }

    function otherFunction() external pure returns (uint256) {
        return 324;
    }

}

// Example of MaliciousToken contract
contract MaliciousToken {
    function decimals() external pure returns (uint256) {
        return 8;
    }
}

contract NumaDecimalsTest is Test {
    
    // test of numaDecimals with NumaToken
    function testDecimalsWithNumaToken() public {
        NumaToken numa = new NumaToken();
        uint256 result = numaDecimals(numa);
        console.log(result);
    }

    // test of numaDecimals with MaliciousToken
    function testDecimalsWithMaliciousToken() public {
        MaliciousToken mToken = new MaliciousToken();
        
        // here we convert the MaliciousToken to NumaToken so that the numaDecimals() can use it
        uint256 result = numaDecimals(NumaToken(address(mToken)));
        console.log(result);
    }

    // the function which expect the user to pass the NumaToken type implementation
    function numaDecimals(NumaToken _contract) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return _contract.decimals();
    }
}
```

Output:

```solidity
[PASS] testDecimalsWithNumaToken() (gas: 63269)
Logs:
  18

[PASS] testDecimalsWithMaliciousToken() (gas: 59601)
Logs:
  8
```

In the code we test the `numaDecimals()` function which expects the `NumaToken` implementation.

And in `testDecimalsWithMaliciousToken` we prove the `numaDecimals()` can also use any contract as long as it implements the one function `numaDecimals()` uses, which is in this case `decimals()` function. 

The `NumaToken` and `MaliciousToken` don’t have anything in common, except the name of the one function which is  `decimals()`.
Therefore we prove the `CNumaToken _collateral` does not need to be a `CNumaToken` implementation and really can be anything the attacker implements, as long as the names of the function or functions are the same.

### Similar Past Reports

Here is our past valid sherlock report where we exploited the same vulnerability. 
We created a malicious contract (malicious erc721) and overrode the `transferFrom` to enter another function before transferring the token. 
By creating a malicious contract and using the contract as collateral, we exploited the protocol to break the functionality.

### Recommendation

Do a similar implementation of whitelisted tokens as Compound for `CToken:961-967`:

```solidity
    uint allowed = comptroller.liquidateBorrowAllowed(
        address(this),
        address(cTokenCollateral),
        liquidator,
        borrower,
        repayAmount
    );

```

As you can see, the `comptroller` checks if the `cTokenCollateral` is allowed and whitelisted (`Comptroller.sol:482-484` :

```solidity
function liquidateBorrowAllowed(
		... 

    if (!markets[cTokenBorrowed].isListed || !markets[cTokenCollateral].isListed) {
        return uint(Error.MARKET_NOT_LISTED);
    }

```

 By checking whitelisted tokens, the Compound prevents the mentioned attack with malicious contracts as collateral, which is not the case for Numa. 

Therefore we highly recommend Numa to use `NumaComptroller.sol` to check for whitelisted tokens.
