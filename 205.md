# Fees from NUMA sales are lost when `feAddress` is disabled

### Summary

There is a function to set the `fee_address` for the protocol and it is possible for the admin to disable it by setting it to `address(0)`


```solidity
File: NumaVault.sol
264:     function setFeeAddress(
265:         address _address,
266:         bool _isFeeReceiver
267:     ) external onlyOwner {
268:         fee_address = payable(_address);
269:         isFeeReceiver = _isFeeReceiver;
270:         emit FeeAddressUpdated(_address);
271:     }

```


### Root Cause


The problem is that fees from NUMA sales  are only accounted for when `fee_address != address(0x0`, if it is disable by the addmin, then fees are lost entirely.

Note that 
- the README did not mention that the `fee_address` cannot be set to zero (when the protocol intends to disable `fee_address`
- L614 condition below shows that it can be disable 


```solidity
File: NumaVault.sol
564:     function sell(
565:         uint256 _numaAmount,
566:         uint256 _minTokenAmount,
567:         address _receiver
568:     ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint _tokenOut) {

//////    ...........

597:  @>     _tokenOut = (tokenAmount * fee) / 1 ether;
598:         require(_tokenOut >= _minTokenAmount, "Min Token");

//// ........
614:     @>  if (fee_address != address(0x0)) {
615:             // fee to be transfered is a percentage of buy/sell fee
616:             uint feeTransferNum = fees * (1 ether - fee);
617:             uint feeTransferDen = uint(BASE_1000) * 1 ether;
618:             uint256 feeAmount = (feeTransferNum * tokenAmount) / // @audit MED: stil 20% of actual fees
619:                 (feeTransferDen); // sent to fee address
620: 
621:             // clip sent fees
622:             uint256 feeAmountMax = (feesMaxAmountPct * tokenAmount) / BASE_1000;
623:             if (feeAmount > feeAmountMax) feeAmount = feeAmountMax;
624: 
625:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(lstToken), fee_address, feeAmount);
626: 
627:             if (isContract(fee_address) && isFeeReceiver) {
628:                 // we don't check result as contract might not implement the deposit function (if multi sig for example)
629:                 fee_address.call(
630:                     abi.encodeWithSignature(
631:                         "DepositFromVault(uint256)",
632:                         feeAmount
633:                     )
634:                 );
635:             }
636: 
637:             emit Fee(feeAmount, fee_address);
638:         }

```

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Fees are completely lost when, `fee_address` is disabled

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider subtracting fees only when `fee_address` is not doing so when it is not set
