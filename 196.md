# Full liquidations using `type(uint256).max` are not possible

### Summary

## Summary
Liquidators can't use `type(uint256).max` to perform full liquidations as it would always revert
## Description
Whenever a full liquidation is performed through `liquidateNumaBorrower`, liquidators can input `type(uint256).max` in order to get assigned the entire borrow amount (+ interest) to liquidate, as seen below
```solidity
        uint borrowAmount = cNuma.borrowBalanceCurrent(_borrower);
        if (_numaAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            numaAmount = borrowAmount;
        }
```
However, further down the execution, this amount is passed into the Comptroller's `liquidateBorrowAllowed` where a `maxClose` factor is applied 
```solidity
            /* The liquidator may not repay more than what is allowed by the closeFactor */
            uint maxClose = mul_ScalarTruncate(
                Exp({mantissa: closeFactorMantissa}),
                borrowBalance
            );
            if (repayAmount > maxClose) { // @audit-issue always fails for type.max
                return uint(Error.TOO_MUCH_REPAY);
            }
```
`repayAmount` is equal exactly to the `borrowBalance` whereas `maxClose` is always a number smaller than `borrowBalance` due to its multiplication by a number < 1.  
The check for `repayAmount` being smaller than `maxClose` will never pass, effectively disabling liquidations using `type(uint256).max`. 

This functionality is very much needed since without it, liquidators are forced to always input the exact number when performing full liquidations, which is not optimal since that number is subject to fluctuations due to partial liquidations executing before the full ones. Additionally, borrowers could front-run repay dust amounts of their debt in order to force reverts due to attempts to repay more than what their dues are.

### Root Cause

- In [`NumaVault.liquidateNumaBorrower`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L983-L987) does not take into consideration the close factor

### Internal pre-conditions

- Liquidator initiates liquidation using input amount type(uint).max

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, wrong logic

### Impact

Unexpected behaviour, broken functionality

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Take into consideration the close factor upon submitting a full liquidation.
