# Liquidators will incur losses when he closes bad debts

### Summary

When a liquidator liquidates bad debt in the protocol, instead of receiving the equivalent value of the repaid amount in the collateral token, they receive a proportional share of the borrower's collateral based on the percentage of the loan they repaid. This approach causes a loss for liquidators because bad debt implies the total value of the borrower's collateral is insufficient to cover their total loan value. So liquidator will get less value from the protocol than the value they have repaid.
Consequently, liquidators are disincentivized to liquidate such loans. Additionally, as bad debts cannot be partially liquidated using the normal `liquidateBorrow` function as liquidators are forced to use `liquidateBadDebt` function once a debt becomes bad debt, liquidators will not liquidate bad debts , which increases protocol risk if the collateral's value decreases further relative to the borrowed token.

### Root Cause

The decision to provide liquidators with a proportional share of the borrower's collateral based on the percentage of bad debt repaid is wrong, as it results in liquidators receiving less value than the amount they have repaid. This discourages liquidators from liquidating bad debts, which negatively impacts the protocol's health.

```solidity
    function liquidateBadDebt(
        address _borrower,
        uint _percentagePosition1000,
        CNumaToken collateralToken
    ) external whenNotPaused notBorrower(_borrower) {

          // ...
        // AUDITV2FIX using borrowBalanceCurrent to get an up to date debt
        //uint borrowAmountFull = borrowToken.borrowBalanceStored(_borrower);
        uint borrowAmountFull = borrowToken.borrowBalanceCurrent(_borrower);
        require(borrowAmountFull > 0, "no borrow");

        uint repayAmount = (borrowAmountFull * _percentagePosition1000) / 1000;

        // user supplied funds
        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            underlyingBorrow,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            repayAmount
        );

        // liquidate
        underlyingBorrow.approve(address(borrowToken), repayAmount);

        borrowToken.liquidateBadDebt(
            _borrower,
            repayAmount,
            _percentagePosition1000,
            CTokenInterface(address(collateralToken))
        );

### Attack Path

1. Suppose 1 Numa = $1 and 1 rETH = $100.  
2. A user provides 100 Numa as collateral and borrows 0.8 rETH.  
3. After borrowing, Numa's price drops to $0.6, turning the loan into bad debt before liquidation.  
4. The collateral is now worth $60, while the borrow is worth $80.  
5. Liquidators cannot partially liquidate using `liquidateBorrow`, as it reverts for bad debt.  
6. If a liquidator repays 50% of the borrow ($40), they receive 50% of the collateral ($30), incurring a $10 loss.  
7. This discourages liquidators, leaving bad debts unresolved.

In Compound, liquidators can atleast partially liquidate a bad debt, reducing protocol risk. But liquidating here causes loss to the liquidator, so bad debts will remain forever and makes the protocol unhealthy if the price of borrow token further increase against collateral token.




### Impact

Bad debts will not be liquidated.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should aim to minimize bad debts by incentivizing liquidators to close as much bad debt as possible.
