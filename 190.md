# Critical Scaling Factor Logic - Potential Zero or Negative CF Issue

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L550
The calculation of the criticalDebaseFactor relies on the assumption that currentCF (current collateral factor) is always non-zero. If currentCF is zero or negative, it could lead to invalid calculations, potentially causing incorrect scaling and disrupting the protocol's behavior.
# Vulnerability Details:
### Issue: The formula for criticalDebaseFactor is (currentCF * BASE_1000) / cf_critical. If currentCF is zero or negative, this calculation may either produce an incorrect result or fail entirely, affecting subsequent logic.
### Impact: This could lead to incorrect scaling for synthetic assets and potentially cause erroneous behavior in fee calculations, price adjustments, or protocol operations.
### Risk: If currentCF can be zero or negative, it could result in unexpected contract behavior, leading to failures or vulnerabilities in the protocol's functionality.

# Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity

uint criticalDebaseFactor = (currentCF * BASE_1000) / cf_critical;
```
If currentCF is zero or negative, criticalDebaseFactor might be incorrectly calculated, causing potential issues in scaling and protocol logic.
# Recommendations
Validation Check: Ensure that currentCF is validated before performing the division. Add a check such as:
```solidity

if (currentCF <= 0) { revert("CF cannot be zero or negative"); }
```
Sanitization: Add input validation for currentCF in the contract to prevent it from being zero or negative, ensuring the correct operation of the scaling logic.
