# Interest-bearing loans will cause unexpected losses for NUMA holders

### Summary

Looking at the documentation quote: "Users can borrow against their NUMA holdings to access `rETH `and stay liquidâ€”interest-free and no fees."  [Lending & Leverage](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hf_zskMHjUxKmXabYi0ehQ9TDSxSVoP8km9UETIYjLI/edit#slide=id.g2e2bfb85334_0_6) Borrowers will incur unintended interest charges when borrowing against their `NUMA `holdings.

### Root Cause

It  arises from the code implementation in `CToken.so`l:  the `borrowFreshNoTransfer` function applies interest to all loans through:
`accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;` wich creates a critical mismatch between promised and actual functionality

### Internal pre-conditions :

The code enforces interest on all loans, breaking a core documented feature of "interest-free loans against NUMA holdings".
```solidity
  function borrowFreshNoTransfer(
        address payable borrower,
        uint borrowAmount
    ) internal virtual {
        /* Fail if borrow not allowed */
        uint allowed = comptroller.borrowAllowed(
            address(this),
            borrower,
            borrowAmount
        );
        if (allowed != 0) {
            revert BorrowComptrollerRejection(allowed);
        }

        /* Verify market's block number equals current block number */
        if (accrualBlockNumber != getBlockNumber()) {
            revert BorrowFreshnessCheck();
        }

        /* Fail gracefully if protocol has insufficient underlying cash */
        if (getCashPrior() < borrowAmount) {
            revert BorrowCashNotAvailable();
        }

        /*
         * We calculate the new borrower and total borrow balances, failing on overflow:
         *  accountBorrowNew = accountBorrow + borrowAmount
         *  totalBorrowsNew = totalBorrows + borrowAmount
         */
        uint accountBorrowsPrev = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);
        uint accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrowsPrev + borrowAmount;
        uint totalBorrowsNew = totalBorrows + borrowAmount;

        /////////////////////////
        // EFFECTS & INTERACTIONS
        // (No safe failures beyond this point)

        /*
         * We write the previously calculated values into storage.
         *  Note: Avoid token reentrancy attacks by writing increased borrow before external transfer.
        `*/
        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;
        accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;
        totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;

        /* We emit a Borrow event */
        emit Borrow(borrower, borrowAmount, accountBorrowsNew, totalBorrowsNew);
    }

```


### Impact

`NUMA `holders suffer continuous losses through unexpected interest charges on supposedly interest-free loans. For example, with a 5% APR and a 10 ETH loan, users would lose 0.5 ETH annually in unintended interest charges.
