# leverageStrategy will revert due users interest rate accrual

### Summary

In the `CNumaToken.leverageStrategy()` function, after borrowing from the market using the `borrowInternalNoTransfer` function, a check is performed to ensure that the user's borrow amount changes only by `borrowAmount` using a `require` statement. However, this check will fail because the user's principal borrow amount will increase by more than `borrowAmount` due to the interest accrued on the user's borrow position.

### Root Cause

```solidity
uint accountBorrowBefore = accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal;
// Borrow but do not transfer borrowed tokens
borrowInternalNoTransfer(borrowAmount, msg.sender);
// uint accountBorrowAfter = accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal;

require(
    (accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal - accountBorrowBefore) == 
        borrowAmount,
    "borrow ko"
);
```

The require statement above will always fail since the user's previous borrow amount accrues interest, causing the principal borrow amount to increase beyond `borrowAmount`.

Even if the global interest rate index is updated, the user's borrow position will only accrue interest when their borrow position is touched as below.

```solidity
    function borrowBalanceStoredInternal(
        address account
    ) internal view returns (uint) {
        /* Get borrowBalance and borrowIndex */
        BorrowSnapshot storage borrowSnapshot = accountBorrows[account];

        /* If borrowBalance = 0 then borrowIndex is likely also 0.
         * Rather than failing the calculation with a division by 0, we immediately return 0 in this case.
         */
        if (borrowSnapshot.principal == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        /* Calculate new borrow balance using the interest index:
         *  recentBorrowBalance = borrower.borrowBalance * market.borrowIndex / borrower.borrowIndex
         */
        uint principalTimesIndex = borrowSnapshot.principal * borrowIndex;
        return principalTimesIndex / borrowSnapshot.interestIndex;
    }
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path



1. Suppose the user has an existing borrow amount of 100. Hence, `accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal = 100`.
2. The user calls the `leverageStrategy` function to borrow an additional 50 from the market.
3. During the borrowing process, interest will accrue on the existing borrow amount. For example, the principal borrow amount will increase to 150.2 (existing borrow = 100, new borrow = 50, accrued interest = 0.2).
4. The `require` statement `(accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal - accountBorrowBefore) == borrowAmount` will then fail because the principal borrow amount includes the accrued interest, making the difference greater than `borrowAmount`.


### Impact

`leverageStrategy` function will fail almost always.

### Mitigation

Instead of directly fetching the user's previous borrow amount from the state using `accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal`, use the `borrowBalanceStored()` function. This function accounts for accrued interest and provides the correct previous borrow balance, ensuring that the `require` statement works as intended.


```diff
- uint accountBorrowBefore = accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal;
+ uint accountBorrowBefore = borrowBalanceStored(msg.sender);
```
