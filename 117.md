# An attacker can drain NumaVault right after deployment

### Summary

The lending part of the protocol, being a fork of Compound v2, is vulnerable to the empty markets exploit. This vulnerability allows an attacker to drain the funds in NumaVault/cToken markets  if there is a market with zero liquidity.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the attack is a rounding issue in the `redeemUnderlying` function. Whenever a user redeems their underlying tokens  the number of shares to burn is calculated as follows:

```solidity
shares to burn = underlying token amount / exchangeRate
```

But instead of rounding up, the number of shares to burn is rounded down in redeemUnderlying function. Due to this, in some cases, one wei fewer number of shares will be burned. The attacker can amplify this rounding error by inflating the `exchangeRate` of the empty market.

```solidity
    function redeemFresh(address payable redeemer, uint redeemTokensIn, uint redeemAmountIn) internal {
        require(redeemTokensIn == 0 || redeemAmountIn == 0, "one of redeemTokensIn or redeemAmountIn must be zero");
        Exp memory exchangeRate = Exp({mantissa: exchangeRateStoredInternal() });

        uint redeemTokens;
        uint redeemAmount;

        if (redeemTokensIn > 0) {
            redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn;
            redeemAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(exchangeRate, redeemTokensIn);
        } else {
@>          redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate);
            redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn;
        }


  

@>      totalSupply = totalSupply - redeemTokens;
        accountTokens[redeemer] = accountTokens[redeemer] - redeemTokens;
    
       ...

    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There needs to be an empty market without liquidity (which happens during the initial protocol deployment).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Let's say the old NumaVault V1 has 500 rETH, and the protocol v2 is redeployed with a new vault and 500 rETH is migrated  to the new vault.  
2. The newly deployed Compound markets have zero liquidity.  
3. Let's assume that out of the 500 rETH, 200 rETH is the maxBorrow amount from NumaVault.
4. Let's say 1 Numa = 0.1 rETH.  

---

1. First, the attacker takes a 5000 Numa flashloan.  
2. The attacker mints cNUMA by depositing a small portion of their Numa into the protocol.  
3. The attacker redeems most of their cNUMA but leaves 2 wei (a very small amount) of cNUMA shares.  
4. The attacker donates 5000 Numa to the cNUMA market by directly transferring them to the contract, which significantly inflates the exchange rate of Numa to cNUMA. The exchange rate becomes 2500 Numa per 1 wei of cNUMA due to the donation.  
5. Currently, there are 2000 Numa (200/0.1) worth of borrowable rETH in the cNUMA market (borrowable rETH from NumaVault).  
6. The attacker then borrows all the rETH from the rETH market, worth 2000 Numa, using their inflated cNUMA as collateral.  
7. The attacker redeems 4999.99999999 Numa from their collateral using the `redeemedUnderlying` function. Due to a rounding error, only 1 wei of cNUMA is burned instead of 1.99999999 wei. The protocol still believes the remaining 1 wei of cNUMA is worth 2500 Numa, which covers their active loan, allowing the attacker to withdraw almost all their collateral tokens.  
8. At this point, the attackerâ€™s borrowing position is fully underwater, and they escape with 200 rETH.



### Impact

NumaVault can be drained upto max borrowable amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

While calculating the number of cTokens to burn in the `cToken.redeemUnderlying()` function, round up the result instead of rounding down.
