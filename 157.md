# The wrong price is used in the calculation of the price of the collateral or borrow of CToken

### Root Cause

NumaComptroller is the brainbox of the lending ecosystem in NUMA. it is how the protocol determines when and how much to borrow, etc. In the determination of the liquidity, shortfall, and bad debt of the user's lending position, NumaComptroller calls `NumaPriceOracleNew::getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral()` or `NumaPriceOracleNew::getUnderlyingPriceAsBorrowed().` These determine the price of the collateral or the value of the borrow made by the user. When we try to retrieve the price of cLST from $NUMA or vice versa, we call `vault::numaToLst()` or `vault::lstToNuma()`. Doing this attempts to retrieve the exchange rate of $NUMA to last and vice versa. The issue here is that in when doing this, the vault tries to retrieve the current value of the lst. 

```solidity
   [NumaVault::lstToNuma](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L691C1-L709C1)
    function lstToNuma(uint256 _amount) external view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = vaultManager
            .getSynthScaling();

        uint256 refValue = last_lsttokenvalueWei;
        (uint256 rwd, uint256 currentvalueWei, ) = rewardsValue();
>>>        if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
            refValue = currentvalueWei;
        }

        uint256 numaAmount = vaultManager.tokenToNuma(
            _amount,
            refValue,
            decimals,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        return (numaAmount * vaultManager.getBuyFee()) / 1 ether;
    }
   ```
In the above function, we get the new current value of last, and we use this value in situations where the reward accruing from the value increase is greater than the set threshold. The implication is that in scenarios where the value gain is less than the threshold, we use the previous value of last, which causes the returned amount of $NUMA to be reduced due to underestimation of the LSTs value

### Impact

1. Loan positions with LSTs as collateral could be undervalued, resulting in unnecessary liquidation and loss of funds to the borrower and vice versa.
2. Loan positions with borrowings in LSTs could be undervalued. Therefore, a position eligible for liquidation isn't liquidated, causing the protocol to accrue bad debt.
