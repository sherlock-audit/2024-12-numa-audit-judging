# Arbitrary from Address in transferFrom (or safeTransferFrom) in CErc20.sol

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CErc20.sol#L183
The transferFrom function allows tokens to be transferred from any from address if approval is set. If an attacker has access to or can manipulate approvals, they could drain tokens from the from address, resulting in loss of funds.

# Vulnerability Details:
### Issue: In the CErc20 contract, the transferFrom function is called with an arbitrary from address without verifying the ownership or validity of the address.
### Impact: An attacker could exploit this by setting approvals to drain tokens from a victim's address.
### Root Cause: Lack of validation or ownership checks for the from address before invoking the transferFrom function.
### Severity: High
### Likelihood: Medium
The likelihood depends on how transferFrom is invoked. If this function is accessible externally or can be influenced by malicious actors, the risk of exploitation increases.

### Impact: High
Loss of Funds: The from address could lose its tokens without the owner's explicit intention or awareness.
Protocol Integrity: Exploitation could lead to significant financial losses and damage trust in the protocol.
## Justification:
### Critical Functionality: This vulnerability affects token transfers, a core component of the protocol's operation.
### Potential Exploitation: If the from address is arbitrary and approvals are manipulable, attackers can target unsuspecting users who have previously granted approvals.
### Mitigation Difficulty: Without proper validation, users are at risk unless they explicitly revoke token approvals, which is unlikely to happen consistently.
# Proof of Concept (PoC):
Attacker identifies a victim's approved address for the token.
Exploits the lack of validation in the following line:
```solidity

token.transferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
```
Transfers tokens from the victim's address to the contract or attacker-controlled address.
# Recommendations:
Validate Ownership: Ensure the from address is the caller or otherwise linked to the transaction initiator.
```solidity
require(msg.sender == from || isApproved(msg.sender, from), "Invalid sender or approval");
```
Use Access Controls: Limit the ability to call transferFrom to authorized roles or ensure the from address is validated within the protocol's logic.
Audit Approvals: Ensure the approval logic cannot be abused to pre-approve malicious actors.
