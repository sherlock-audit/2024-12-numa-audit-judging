# Vault will stop accruing rewards once rETH hits an all-time-high

### Summary

## Summary
Rewards won't be updated unless the current price of rETH has surpassed the last recorded snapshot, meaning that no rewards will accrue after an all-time-high which will remain as a reference stale price.
## Description
Let's observe the method which calculates and distributes rewards, `rewardsValue`. 
```solidity
    function rewardsValue() public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        require(address(oracle) != address(0), "oracle not set");
        uint currentvalueWei = oracle.getTokenPrice(decimals);
        if (currentvalueWei <= last_lsttokenvalueWei) {
            return (0, currentvalueWei, 0); // @audit-issue rewards are always 0 until surpassed
        }
    }
```
We can see that in order for any accrual to take place, the current rETH price must surpass the last recorded snapshot. The real problem arises in `extractRewardsNoRequire`, the function calling the method above. 

```solidity
    function extractRewardsNoRequire() internal {
        if (block.timestamp >= (last_extracttimestamp + 24 hours)) {
            (
                uint256 rwd,  // returns 0
                uint256 currentvalueWei,
                uint256 rwdDebt
            ) = rewardsValue();
            if (rwd > rwd_threshold) { // @audit-issue this will never pass even when threshold is 0
                extractInternal(rwd, currentvalueWei, rwdDebt);
            }
        }
    }
```
We observe that whenever `rwd = 0`, the if-statement will never pass even at `rwd_threshold = 0`. The logic will not pass the if-statement and `extractInternal` won't be called which is the only function responsible for updating `last_lsttokenvalueWei` which is a critical variable used as reference value across the entire `NumaVault`. Summed up, if the current price does not surpass `last_lsttokenvalueWei`, no rewards will accrue and `last_lsttokenvalueWei` won't be updated either, remaining as stale and inflated price. 

A more illustrative example can be made by observing the [annual rETH chart](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth), March 2024 was priced ~4400$ which was not broken until December 2024, meaning that if the vault was live during this period, it would have operated for 9 months at a stale price and not accruing any rewards.


### Root Cause

- In [`NumaVault.rewardsValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L330-L332) rewards are always 0 unless the price has increased
- If the rewards are always 0, [`extractInternal`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L383-L384) will never update `last_lsttokenvalueWei`

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

- The LST token hits a new high price

### Attack Path

1. LST token hits a new high price, e.g rETH hits 4400$ in March 2024
2. This price is not surpassed till December 2024
3. Vault does not accrue any rewards and operates with stale price of 4400$ for the entire duration

### Impact

- no rewards are accrued
- vault operates with inflated and stale token price

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either rewrite the if-statement to pass when `rwd = rwd_threshold`, get rid of it entirely or let the state change of `last_lsttokenvalueWei` take place in another method.
