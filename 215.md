# Reward calculation does not track trading volume during the 24-hour cooldown

### Summary

## Description
Let's observe how reward accrual is calculated
```solidity
    function rewardsValue() public view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        require(address(oracle) != address(0), "oracle not set");
        uint currentvalueWei = oracle.getTokenPrice(decimals);
        if (currentvalueWei <= last_lsttokenvalueWei) {
            return (0, currentvalueWei, 0);
        }
        uint diff = (currentvalueWei - last_lsttokenvalueWei);
        uint balance = getVaultBalanceNoDebt(); // @audit-issue uses live lst.balanceOf
        uint rwd = FullMath.mulDiv(balance, diff, currentvalueWei);
        uint debtRwd = FullMath.mulDiv(
            (debt - rewardsFromDebt),
            diff,
            currentvalueWei
        );
        return (rwd, currentvalueWei, debtRwd);
    }
```
We can immediately observe 2 weakpoints:
1. It happens once every 24-hours before going on cooldown
2. It fetches current lst.balanceOf(address(vault))

This means that rewards can be severely undermined in instances such as:
1. Vault gets updated and is left with 10_000 USD worth of rETH, `extractRewardsNoRequire` goes on 24-hour cooldown
2. During this cooldown a day of high trading volume takes place, vault holdings double to 20_000 USD worth of rETH and then back to 10_000
3. Vault is updated again after the cooldown expires, basing rewards on the 10_000 USD worth of rETH balance
4. The trading volume during the cooldown is treated as if it never happened, no rewards had been accrued during that time.

### Root Cause

- Rewards are accrued only once, every 24 hours via [`NumaVault.extractRewardsNoRequire`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L376-L377) instead of every time the contract's balance changes

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Users deposit funds in the protocol right after the vault had been updated
2. Users engage in trading activity, giving out loans, etc.
3. Users pull out their funds from the vault before the 24-hour cooldown expires
4. Vault is updated again and rewards are accrued against the low balance
5. Trading volume in the past day was unaccounted, less rewards had been accrued

### Impact

- unexpected behaviour
- partial loss of rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Track rewards on each balance changing action and store it as a state variable
Something like `rwd += (balanceAfter - balanceBefore) * diff` and pay it off once every 24 hours.
