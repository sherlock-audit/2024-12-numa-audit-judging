# Fee Calculation Inconsistency Due to Mismatched Basis (Base 1000 vs. Base 10000)

### Summary

The `_transferWithFee` function incorrectly calculates fees using a basis of 10000 while the documentation and expected behavior specify a base of 1000. This inconsistency results in significantly reduced fees being applied or transferred to designated addresses, creating potential financial discrepancies or governance issues.

Affected code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/Numa.sol#L118-L128

Documentation:
fees sent to fee address: percentage of buy/sell fee in base 1000
Example: 200 â†’ 20% of fees sent to fee_address

### Root Cause

The function `_transferWithFee` calculates fees using a denominator of 10000 (fee / 10000) instead of the 1000 base documented and expected by the system. This mismatch leads to a 10x reduction in the calculated fee amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `_transferWithFee` function is called with a fee parameter assumed to be based on a denominator of 1000 (as per the documentation). The code incorrectly uses 10000 as the denominator for the fee calculation.

### External pre-conditions

The system relies on fees to operate correctly and distribute rewards or governance funds.
External stakeholders or contracts expect the correct fee allocation based on a 1000 denominator.

### Attack Path

A user initiates a transaction that invokes the _transferWithFee function.
Due to the incorrect fee calculation:
The amountToBurn is calculated as (amount * fee) / 10000 instead of (amount * fee) / 1000.
Fees are reduced by 10x, leading to insufficient burns or incorrect transfers to designated addresses.

### Impact

Reduced burn rate for tokens, potentially leading to inflation or imbalance.

### PoC

Deploy the contract and call _transferWithFee with the following inputs:
amount = 1000
fee = 200 (representing 20% per the documentation).
Expected Behavior (Base 1000):
amountToBurn = (1000 * 200) / 1000 = 200.
Actual Behavior (Base 10000):
amountToBurn = (1000 * 200) / 10000 = 20

Steps to Reproduce:
Deploy the contract with the _transferWithFee function.
Call _transferWithFee(from, to, 1000, 200).
Observe that only 20 tokens are burned instead of 200, resulting in a discrepancy.

### Mitigation

uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 1000;
