# Reentrancy Vulnerability in Rewards Extraction (extractInternal)

### Summary

The lack of a reentrancy guard in the `extractInternal` function will cause a complete loss of funds for the vault as an attacker will deploy a malicious contract as `rwd_address` to reenter the vault and execute unauthorized actions during reward extraction.



### Root Cause

In NumaVault.sol:363-364, the call to `rwd_address.call()` in extractInternal does not include a reentrancy guard or proper validation. This allows a malicious contract deployed as `rwd_address` to exploit the vault by reentering during the reward extraction process.

### Internal pre-conditions

1-rwd_address must be set to a contract controlled by the attacker.
2-The vault must contain sufficient lstToken liquidity for the initial reward transfer.
3-The function extractRewardsNoRequire must calculate a valid rwd value to trigger extractInternal.

### External pre-conditions

1-A transaction must trigger extractRewardsNoRequire (e.g., through a buy, sell, or manual call).
2-The malicious rwd_address contract must include a fallback function that can reenter the vault.

### Attack Path

-The attacker deploys a contract with the following fallback function:
```solidity
fallback() external payable {
    NumaVault(msg.sender).buy(1, 0, address(this)); // Reenter the vault
}
```
- This malicious contract is set as rwd_address.

-The attacker waits until extractRewardsNoRequire is callable (e.g., 24 hours since the last extraction).

-They trigger the extraction by interacting with the vault (e.g., through a buy or sell transaction).

-When `rwd_address.call()` is executed in `extractInternal`, the malicious contract’s fallback function is triggered.

-The fallback function reenters the vault and performs unauthorized actions (e.g., calling buy or sell to manipulate state or drain funds).

Easy drain Funds:

- Reentrancy allows the attacker to bypass expected state changes or safeguards in the vault, enabling them to drain funds or disrupt operations.

### Impact

Affected Party: The vault and all users.
Loss: Complete depletion of the vault’s liquidity and potential manipulation of internal state.
- Gain: The attacker gains control over all funds stored in the vault.

        // Fund the vault
        lstToken.mint(address(vault), 1_000e18);

        // Deploy malicious contract
        maliciousReceiver = new MaliciousRewardReceiver(vault);
        vault.setRwdAddress(address(maliciousReceiver), true);
    }

    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        // Trigger reward extraction
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days); // Simulate passage of 24 hours
        vault.extractRewardsNoRequire();

        // Assert that the vault's liquidity is drained
        uint256 vaultBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(vault));
        uint256 attackerBalance = lstToken.balanceOf(address(maliciousReceiver));

        console.log("Vault Balance:", vaultBalance);
        console.log("Attacker Balance:", attackerBalance);

        // Verify attacker drained funds
        assertEq(vaultBalance, 0);
        assertEq(attackerBalance, 1_000e18);
    }
}

```
Vault holds 1,000 LST tokens; attacker balance is 0.
- After Exploit: The malicious contract reenters the vault during reward extraction, calling buy to manipulate state and drain all 1,000 LST tokens.

### Mitigation

Add a Reentrancy Guard:
Protect extractInternal and related functions from reentrant calls:

```solidity

function extractInternal(uint rwd, uint currentvalueWei, uint rwdDebt) internal nonReentrant {

}
```
