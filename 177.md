# borrowers will get liquidated unfairly

### Summary

when borrowers borrow from the ctoken contract the contract fetches the price of collateral and borrow tokens from NumaPriceOracleNew after the borrowing is complete the liquidator can liquidate these positions if the collateral value drops below the borrow value after applying the collateralfactor however due to the collateral factor on numavault.sol these positions can be unfairly liquidated when liquidator calls liquidateBorrow the code calls liquidateBorrowAllowed in the numacomptroller.sol contract which then calls getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal in the function getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral and getUnderlyingPriceAsBorrowed is called to fetch the price of the collateral and borrow tokens
however due to how the oracle returns price the borrowers position can be liquidated because there is a fee that is applied on amounts the fee applied on borrow is fixed however the fee applied on collateral is dynamic and increases when the collateral factor in vaultmanager.sol which makes the collateral value less compared to the borrow value

     function getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral(
        CNumaToken cToken
    ) public view override returns (uint) {
        INumaVault vault = cToken.vault();
        require((address(vault) != address(0)), "no vault");


        if (address(cToken) == vault.getcNumaAddress()) {
            // numa price from vault
            return vault.numaToLst(1e18);
        } else if (address(cToken) == vault.getcLstAddress()) {
            //
            return 1e18; // rEth has 18 decimals
        } else {
            revert("unsupported token");
        }

the function calls vault.numatolst

    function numaToLst(uint256 _amount) external view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = vaultManager
            .getSynthScaling();


        uint256 refValue = last_lsttokenvalueWei;
        (uint256 rwd, uint256 currentvalueWei, ) = rewardsValue();
        if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
            refValue = currentvalueWei;
        }


        uint256 tokenAmount = vaultManager.numaToToken(
            _amount,
            refValue,
            decimals,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );


        (uint sellFee, , ) = vaultManager.getSellFeeScaling();
        return (tokenAmount * sellFee) / 1 ether;  ------>@audit 
    }

which then calls vaultmanager,getsellfeescaling

inside the getsellfeescaling we can see the fee is increased based on the cf this will cause unfair liquidations for borrower if the fee is increased leading to drop in the valuation of collateral and making the borrower eligible for liquidations

whereas the buyfee which is applied on borrow tokens are fixed

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

unfair liquidations the vaults cf shouldnt affect the liquidations on ctoken contracts due to how the price is fetched it will cause unfair liquidations when the collateral value decreases significantly when the fee is increased
