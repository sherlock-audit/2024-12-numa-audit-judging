# Inflated ETH Conversion in Numa to ETH conversion from vault in `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma`

### Summary

The `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma` function in the `NumaPrinter` contract incorrectly calculates the ETH equivalent of `Numa` tokens due to an inflated buy fee applied in the `numaToEth` function of the `VaultManager` contract. This results in an inaccurate conversion rate from vault when minting `nuAssets`.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L354


The `numaToEth` function in the `VaultManager` contract applies a buy fee to the ETH amount returned by inflating the value returned with buy fee
```solidity
       function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken(
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );
        if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
  >>          result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee();
        } else if (_t == PriceType.SellPrice) {
            (uint sellfee, , ) = getSellFeeScaling();
            result = (result * sellfee) / 1 ether;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
This leads to an incorrect ETH equivalent for the Numa tokens passed in the vaultmanager

### Internal pre-conditions

numaToEth is called with PriceType.BuyPrice.
Buy fee is applied within numaToEth function in `Vaultmanager`

### External pre-conditions

`getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma` is called to convert Numa to nuAssets.
VaultManager is integrated with NumaPrinter.

### Attack Path

User calls `getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma` through `mintAssetFromNumaInput`
`numaToEth` inflates ETH value due to buy fee.

### Impact

The inflated ETH conversion causes the system to default to using the pool price for nuAsset minting, even when the vault price would be more favorable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 ethAmountVault = vaultManager.numaToEth(
            _numaAmount - amountToBurn,
 +           IVaultManager.PriceType.SellPrice
        );
```
