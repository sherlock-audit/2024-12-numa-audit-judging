# No slippage check for leverageStrategy function

### Summary

When a user opens a leveraged position using the CNumaToken.leverageStrategy() function, there is no slippage protection to limit the price at which tokens are bought by the strategy contract. As a result, if the tokens are purchased at an unfavorable price, the user may incur more debt than expected. Additionally, the function lacks a deadline parameter to ensure that the transaction is executed within a specified timeframe. Without this parameter, if the transaction is delayed, the user has no control over the price at which the tokens are purchased, increasing their risk.

### Root Cause

In [CNumaToken.sol:193](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L193), there is no slippage check for the `borrowAmount`. As a result, if the tokens are purchased at a worse price than expected, the user may incur more debt than intended.

```solidity
    function leverageStrategy(
        uint _suppliedAmount, // 1O Numa 
        uint _borrowAmount, // 40 Numa -> rETH
        CNumaToken _collateral,
        uint _strategyIndex
    ) external {
    
       // ...
       
        // how much to we need to borrow to repay vault
        // @audit-issue There should slippage protection here. Otherwise user will incur more debt if tokens are swap at worst price
        uint borrowAmount = strat.getAmountIn(_borrowAmount, false);
      

        uint accountBorrowBefore = accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal;
       
        borrowInternalNoTransfer(borrowAmount, msg.sender);
   
        
        require(
            (accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal - accountBorrowBefore) ==
                borrowAmount,
            "borrow ko"
        );
        
                // swap
        EIP20Interface(underlying).approve(address(strat), borrowAmount);
        (uint collateralReceived, uint unUsedInput) = strat.swap(
            borrowAmount,
            _borrowAmount,
            false
        );


    }
   ```

The `closeLeverageStrategy` function also lacks slippage protection.

### Attack Path

Let's assume 1 Numa = 0.1 rETH.

1. The user calls `leverageStrategy(10, 40, cNuma)` to open a 5x leveraged position in Numa tokens.
2. 10 Numa will be supplied by the user, and 40 Numa will be flash-borrowed from the Numa Vault by the cReth contract.
3. These 50 Numa will be supplied as collateral to the cNuma market.
4. The cReth contract will then borrow rETH against the provided collateral (50 Numa in step 3) and exchange it for Numa to repay the 40 Numa flash loan taken in step 2.
5. The user expects to incur 4 rETH of debt (40 Numa * 0.1 rETH per Numa). However, there is no control over the price at which the swap occurs. If the swap happens at a worse price, for example, 1 Numa = 0.15 rETH, the user will incur 6 rETH of debt instead of the expected 4 rETH. This price discrepancy results in a loss for the user.



### Impact

User will incur more debt that expected due to lack of slippage check.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection for `borrowAmount` in `leverageStrategy` function.


```diff
    function leverageStrategy(
        uint _suppliedAmount, // 1O Numa 
        uint _borrowAmount, // 40 Numa -> rETH
        CNumaToken _collateral,
        uint _strategyIndex
    ) external {
    
       // ...
       
        // how much to we need to borrow to repay vault
        // @audit-issue There should slippage protection here. Otherwise user will incur more debt if tokens are swap at worst price
        uint borrowAmount = strat.getAmountIn(_borrowAmount, false);
+       require(borrowAmount <= maxBorrowAmount);
      

        uint accountBorrowBefore = accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal;
       
        borrowInternalNoTransfer(borrowAmount, msg.sender);
   
        
        require(
            (accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal - accountBorrowBefore) ==
                borrowAmount,
            "borrow ko"
        );
        
                // swap
        EIP20Interface(underlying).approve(address(strat), borrowAmount);
        (uint collateralReceived, uint unUsedInput) = strat.swap(
            borrowAmount,
            _borrowAmount,
            false
        );


    }
   ```
Also add slippage protection for `closeLeverageStrategy` function.
