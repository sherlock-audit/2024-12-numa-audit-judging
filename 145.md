# Misalignment Between `_maxSpotOffsetBps` Limit and Documentation

### Summary

The `setMaxSpotOffsetBps` function enforces a limit of `_maxSpotOffsetBps` being less than 10000 (100%) but provides an error message that incorrectly specifies the maximum limit as "less than 100%". Additionally, the documentation implies that `_maxSpotOffsetBps` should have an upper limit of 1000 (10%), consistent with its default value of 145 bps (1.45%). This discrepancy can result in misconfiguration of the system, leading to potential destabilization of synthetic pricing.

Ducumentation: "_maxSpotOffsetBps:used to modulate the weight of the spot price in numa pricing for synthetics. See white paper for more precision.

numasyntheticMintPrice=min(numabuyPrice,numaLP15minPrice,numaLP30minPrice,numaLPspotPrice*(1+maxSpotOffsetPct))

numasyntheticRetirePrice=max(numasellPrice,numaLP15minPrice,numaLP30minPrice,numaLPspotPrice*(1-maxSpotOffsetPct))

Where maxSpotOffsetPct is an admin modifiable offset percentage variable, default ~1.45%
1.45% represents the estimated natural peg variance caused by sequential fees;

### Root Cause

The function enforces a limit of 100% (10000 bps), but the error message suggests a maximum of 100% (incorrectly described as 100 bps). Furthermore, the documentation implies an intended maximum limit of 10% (1000 bps) for `_maxSpotOffsetBps`.

### Internal pre-conditions

`_maxSpotOffsetBps` is set through the `setMaxSpotOffsetBps` function.
The system does not validate whether `_maxSpotOffsetBps` exceeds a practical or expected range beyond the error message enforcement.

### External pre-conditions

The administrator calls `setMaxSpotOffsetBps` with a value significantly above 10% (1000 bps).
The administrator relies on the misleading error message or documentation to interpret valid input values.

### Attack Path

An administrator configures `_maxSpotOffsetBps` with a value close to 100% (10000 bps), believing this is acceptable based on the error message or misunderstanding the documentation.

### Impact

Synthetic pricing may deviate significantly from expected values.

### PoC

Call the `setMaxSpotOffsetBps` function with `_maxSpotOffsetBps` = 9999.
Observe that the function accepts the value without error.
Note the resulting instability in pricing calculations for synthetic assets due to extreme offset modulation, especially for `numasyntheticMintPrice` and `numasyntheticRetirePrice`.

### Mitigation

require(_maxSpotOffsetBps < 1000, "percentage must be less than 10%");
