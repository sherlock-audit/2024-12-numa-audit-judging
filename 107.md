# Surplus Collateral Refund Leads to Imbalance Between C_Tokens (represents leveraging)and Underlying Collateral.

### Summary

The `leverageStrategy` function refunds surplus collateral in underlying tokens to the user without minting additional `cTokens`. This creates a mismatch between the user's tokenized share (cTokens) and the underlying collateral in the protocol. Over time, this discrepancy can drain the protocol's reserves.

More number of underlying_Tokens being transferred to the user,  if collateralReceived > _borrowAmount.

### Root Cause

The function transfers the entire minted `CToken` amount to the user immediately after minting. Later, if surplus collateral is received during the swap by `NumaLeverage`, it is refunded to the user in underlying tokens without updating the `CToken` balance or minting new `CTokens`. This breaks the parity between underlying-tokens & `CTokens` minted which represents how much user Leveraged, results user got more tokens of underlying-tokens but `CTokens` which are minted are less by the difference of `collateralReceived - _borrowAmount`.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. Surplus collateral (collateralReceived > _borrowAmount) is generated during the swap operation.
2. The protocol assumes that the user's `CTokens` accurately represent their claim on the underlying collateral, which is not correct.


### External pre-conditions

only External pre-conditions required is swap operation returning more number of underlying_tokens.

### Attack Path

1. A user repeatedly uses `leverageStrategy` that result in surplus collateral after the swap.
2. If the swap resulted in surplus user got that surplus amount underlying collateral tokens without the ctokens Representing that surplus amount.
3. Over time, the user withdraws or redeems more collateral than they are entitled to, draining the protocolâ€™s reserves.

### Impact

Inaccurate Accounting: The protocol's accounting of collateral and `cTokens` becomes inconsistent, leading to potential insolvency.

### PoC

```solidity 
       // repay flashloan
        EIP20Interface(underlyingCollateral).approve(
            address(vault),
            _borrowAmount
        );
        vault.repayLeverage(false);

        //refund if more collateral is received than needed
        if (collateralReceived > _borrowAmount) {
            // send back the surplus
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(underlyingCollateral),
                msg.sender,
                collateralReceived - _borrowAmount
            );
        }
```

### Mitigation

Mint Additional cTokens for Surplus.
```solidity
if (collateralReceived > _borrowAmount) {
         uint surplus = collateralReceived - _borrowAmount;
@> mint additional surplus amount of Ctokens
        _collateral.mint(surplus);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(address(_collateral)), msg.sender, surplusCTokens);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(
                IERC20(underlyingCollateral),
                msg.sender,
                collateralReceived - _borrowAmount
            );
}
```
