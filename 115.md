# `last_lsttokenvalueWei` can be an outdated price of `rETH/ETH` leading to incorrect calculations and conversions that can be exploited.

### Summary

The `last_lsttokenvalueWei` which represents `rETH/ETH` price is updated once every 24 hours in `NumaVault` which can result to the usage of an outdated price in the interval and the conversion will be incorrect.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this vulnerability is that the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` in `NumaVault` is updated once every 24 hours during the call of `NumaVault::updateVaultAndUpdateDebasing()`. Let's see this function :

```solidity
    function updateVaultAndUpdateDebasing()
        public
        returns (
            uint scale,
            uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee,
            uint sell_fee_result
        )
    {
        // accrue interest
        updateVault();
        // update scaling and sell_fee
        (
            scale,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee,
            sell_fee_result
        ) = vaultManager.updateDebasings();
    }
```

This function is called upon every action on the vault and the `updateVault()` triggering is responsible for updating the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` and "extracting" rewards. Let's see the `NumaVault::updateVault()` :

```solidity
    function updateVault() public {
        // extract rewards if any
        extractRewardsNoRequire();

        // accrue interest
        if (address(cLstToken) != address(0)) cLstToken.accrueInterest();
    }

    function extractRewardsNoRequire() internal {
@>        if (block.timestamp >= (last_extracttimestamp + 24 hours)) {
            (
                uint256 rwd,
                uint256 currentvalueWei,
                uint256 rwdDebt
            ) = rewardsValue();
            if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
                extractInternal(rwd, currentvalueWei, rwdDebt);
            }
        }
    }
```

As we can see, the extraction will happen once every 24 hours **and only if the rewards have surpassed the threshold". This means that for this 24 hours interval the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` will be fixed to the previous one calculated. However, this can be an outdated price since the actual price may have changed due to natural market conditions(a problem on Rocket Pool), a network event on the RP validators or/and staking rewards distribution to the validators as of Rocket Pool mechanics. However, as it will be explained on the impact, this can be a problem for the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is updated at `T` hour.
2. The actual `rETH/ETH` price changes at `T+4` hour.
3. Attacker can takes advantage of the outdated `last_lsttokenvalueWei` which no longer represent the actual `rETH/ETH` and calls `buy/sell` or any other function that is reading it to make calculations between `rETH` collateral balance and `ETH`.

### Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that attacker will be able to take advantage of an outdated price of `rETH/ETH` which would have been calculated up to 24 hours before the current time and there will be absolutely no way to prevent this. As a result would exploit `last_lsttokenvalueWei` to their advantage by either buy NUMA or sell NUMA or any other action that takes `last_lsttokenvalueWei` as granted and source of truth.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider updating the `last_lsttokenvalueWei` more frequently or even having a way to update it emergently in a case of `rETH/ETH` big price change.
