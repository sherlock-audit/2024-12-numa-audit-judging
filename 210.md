# Buy fees can increase more than the described value in the whitepaper

### Summary

## Description
As per the docs:
> Buy fee can only increase 5% per 24 hours: e.g., from 5% to 10%, 10% to 15%, etc.

However `updateBuyFeePID` has a `buyPID_incMaxRate = 1.66%` and is callable once every 4 hours (or 6 times a day), meaning that fees can go upwards to 6 * 1.66% = 9.96% in 24 hours. In cases of large trading volume, users would expect the buy fee to increase at most by 5% every 24 hours, however they will be charged more than anticipated

### Root Cause

In [`VaultManager.updateBuyFeePID`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L342) can increase by 1.66% every 4 hours

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

- Significant trading volume and high demand for minting Numa

### Attack Path

1. Users trade Numa, knowing that the buy fees can't increase more than 5% within a day
2. Fees rise by ~10%
3. Numa buyers pay more fees than expected

### Impact

- unexpected behaviour
- partial loss of funds for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure the following invariant holds: `(24 / nextCheckBlockWindowDelta) * buyPID_incMaxRate <= 5%`
