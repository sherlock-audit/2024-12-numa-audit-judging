# Rounding in the difference between vault and LP percentage diff may cause `buy_fee` to not be updated when it should

### Summary

`VaultManager::updateBuyFeePID()` is used to change the `buy_fee` depending on several things.

The amount of Numa traded, if it a sell or a buy, difference between LP & Vault - [pctFromBuyPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L331).

If the LP price is 2.5% more or less than the vault's price and the user is selling `Numa`, we are going to decrease the `buy_fee` by a certain amount (depending on how much `Numa` we are trading, etc.)

The issue is that the precision is low and we are just checking if is more than 25 (we are using 1e3 precision).

But if the number that was computed in `pctFromBuyPrice` was 25.85 (2.585%), it is going to round down to 25 and not pass 
the [if condition here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L350-L352) to make the `buy_fee` smaller

### Root Cause

The root cause is the small precision that the protocol is using (1e3), which will NOT make the `buy_fee` to take less fee from users, thus leading users to overpay for selling `Numa` in certain conditions.

Given that it is unlikely that high divergence of prices to exist between vault & LP due to arbitrage, this gives us a very plausible scenario in which rounding makes the if NOT to pass and thus not make the `buy_fee` to charge less

### Internal pre-conditions

`pctFromBuyPrice` is calculated to be 25.01-25.99 (we know that the remainder will NOT remain due to how Solidity works)

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `NumaVault::sell()` to sell `Numa` passing $2.5k dollars in `Numa` to sell given the LP & Vault price are having a difference between 2.5% and 2.6%
2. Bob then decides to buy `Numa` with $10k dollars, but given that the rounding prevented the `buy_fee`, Bob will be slightly overcharged

### Impact

`buy_fee` is going to have a slightly incorrect value given the circumstances, which will make the user overpay 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a higher precision for calculating difference in percentages between LP & Vault prices
