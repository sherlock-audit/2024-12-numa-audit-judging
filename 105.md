# Empty market inflation attack

### Summary

Due to a rounding error in `redeemUnderlying` function, when a new cToken market is added(i.e. there is a market with zero liquidity.), an attacker can drain liquidity in all other avaliable markets. 

### Root Cause

In the following report, we do not differentiate between cNumaLST and cNumaToken. They have same `cToken` implementation.

The root cause of the attack is a rounding issue in the `redeemUnderlyingInternal` function, which calls `CToken::redeemFresh()`:
[`CToken.sol:L608`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L608):

```solidity
        /* If redeemTokensIn > 0: */
        if (redeemTokensIn > 0) {
            /*
             * We calculate the exchange rate and the amount of underlying to be redeemed:
             *  redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn
             *  redeemAmount = redeemTokensIn x exchangeRateCurrent
             */
            redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn;
            redeemAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(exchangeRate, redeemTokensIn);
        } else {
            /*
             * We get the current exchange rate and calculate the amount to be redeemed:
             *  redeemTokens = redeemAmountIn / exchangeRate
             *  redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn
             */
            //@Audit Empty market attack!
            redeemTokens = div_(redeemAmountIn, exchangeRate);
            redeemAmount = redeemAmountIn;
        }
```

Whenever a user redeems their underlying tokens, the number of shares to burn is calculated as follows:

`shares to burn = underlying token amount / exchangeRate`

Instead of rounding up, the number of shares to burn is rounded down in `redeemUnderlying` function. Due to this, in some cases, one wei fewer number of shares will be burned. At first glance, this doesn’t seem like an issue because, after all, it’s just one wei of share. In a normal market, this one wei of share isn’t even worth one cent. But what if that one wei of share is worth 250 bitcoins? However the attacker is able to amplify this small rounding error by inflating the exchange rate.

Since the value of `exchangeRate` in `exchangeRateStoredInternal` function depends on the amount of the underlying asset tokens held by the contract, it is possible to manipulate the price of the cToken by transferring a large amount of the underlying asset tokens to the cToken contract.

Now we have the attack:

We consider the scenario: a new LST market is just initialized.(we say it is wstETH)

1. First the attacker get a WETH flashloan and wrap them to 500 wstETH.
2. Then attacker uses a small portion of his wstETH to mint cNumawstETH(shares), before redeeming all but 2 wei.
3. Then the attacker donated 500 wstETH to the protocol by doing a direct transfer to inflate the exchangeRate to 250 wstETH/ 1 Wei cNumawstETH.
4. Now the attacker borrowed 100 wstETH worth of rETH from rETH market.
5. Then the attacker redeemed 499.99999999 wstETH from their collateral using the `redeemedUnderlying` function. However, instead of burning 1.99999999 wei of cNumawstETH, only 1 wei of cNumawstETH was burned due to a rounding error. At this point, the attacker was able to withdraw almost all of their collateral tokens, despite having an outstanding loan worth 100 wstETH, because the protocol still thinks that their remaining 1 wei of cNumawstETH is still worth 250 wstETH which covered their active loan.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin add a new market.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. First the attacker get a WETH flashloan and wrap them to 500 wstETH.
2. Then attacker uses a small portion of his wstETH to mint cNumawstETH(shares), before redeeming all but 2 wei.
3. Then the attacker donated 500 wstETH to the protocol by doing a direct transfer to inflate the exchangeRate to 250 wstETH/ 1 Wei cNumawstETH.
4. Now the attacker borrowed 100 wstETH worth of rETH from rETH market.
5. Then the attacker redeemed 499.99999999 wstETH from their collateral using the `redeemedUnderlying` function. However, instead of burning 1.99999999 wei of cNumawstETH, only 1 wei of cNumawstETH was burned due to a rounding error. At this point, the attacker was able to withdraw almost all of their collateral tokens, despite having an outstanding loan worth 100 wstETH, because the protocol still thinks that their remaining 1 wei of cNumawstETH is still worth 250 wstETH which covered their active loan.

### Impact

Direct steal from protocol

### PoC

No need.

### Mitigation

When listing a new collateral token, first set its collateral factor to zero, then mint some shares, send them to the zero address, then change the collateral factor to the desired value.
