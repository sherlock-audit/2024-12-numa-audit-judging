# lack of slippage

### Summary

the redeem function in ctoken.sol lacks slippage protection this allows users to get griefed
when users call redeem it calls internal redeem function mintInternal the amount users receive is calculated as

             */
            redeemTokens = redeemTokensIn;
            redeemAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(exchangeRate, redeemTokensIn);


higher the exchange rate more the user will receive however there is no slippage protection for the redeemer which can cause loss of funds because the exchange rate is calculated as

            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;


            return exchangeRate;
        }

the higher the borrows and total cash the higher the exchange rate however no slippage protection allows users to get griefed 
because when a user repays their borrows

        uint accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrowsPrev - actualRepayAmount;
        uint totalBorrowsNew = totalBorrows - actualRepayAmount;


        /* We write the previously calculated values into storage */
        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;
        accountBorrows[borrower].interestIndex = borrowIndex;
        totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;


the total borrows is reduced by that amount which directly impacts the exchange rate since lower the total borrows value lower the exchange rate thus the user who called redeem will receive less than the intended amount this is a problem even without a malicious borrower because previous transactions affect the exchange rate directly but a borrower with malicious intent can also grief a user by frontrunning a redeem transaction and repaying his loan and decreasing the exchange rate 

mint also lacks a slippage check

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user calls redeem to redeem his token
2. malicious borrower sees his transaction on the mempool and frontruns him repaying his loan
3. the exchange rate is decreased due to the previous repay transaction
4. user receives very less than the intended amount

### Impact

loss of funds for users 

### PoC

### Mitigation

add a slippage protection
