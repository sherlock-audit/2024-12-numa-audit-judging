# borrowRateMaxMantissa should be tailored to the specific chain on which the protocol is deployed

### Summary

The purpose of borrowRateMaxMantissa is to trigger the protocol's failure mode when excessive utilization causes the borrow rate to become unreasonably high https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L442-L445
It is defined as a constant across all chains, but it should ideally be adjusted based on the average block time of the specific chain where the protocol is deployed

    // Maximum borrow rate that can ever be applied (.0005% / block)
    uint internal constant borrowRateMaxMantissa = 0.0005e16;

borrowRateMaxMantissa = 0.0005e16 translates to maximum borrow rate of .0005% / block.
For Ethereum chain that has 12 seconds of average block time, this translates to maximum borrow rate of `0.0005% * (365 * 24 * 3600)/12 = 1314`

The protocol will be deployed to three chains: Arbitrum, Base, and Ethereum. Below are the calculations for the maximum borrow rate

- Ethereum (12-second block time):
  - Blocks per year:  
    (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) / 12 = 2,628,000
  - Maximum borrow rate:  
    0.0005e16 * 2,628,000 = 131.4%

- Base (2-second block time):
  - Blocks per year:  
    (365 * 24 * 60 * 60) / 2 = 15,768,000
  - Maximum borrow rate:  
    0.0005e16 * 15,768,000 = 788.4%

- Arbitrum (Variable block time):
  - Average block time: 0.25s to 2s
  - Blocks per year (assuming 1s block time):  
    365 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 31,536,000
  - Maximum borrow rate:  
    0.0005e16 * 31,536,000 = 1576.8%

### Mitigation
borrowRateMaxMantissa should be set to the proper value instead of the current value  change `borrowRateMaxMantissa` according to what chain it is being deployed to.
