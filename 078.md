# Checks not implemented for lower & upper bounds of closeFactorMantissa

## Description
`NumaComptroller.sol` [specifies that](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L104-L108):
```js
@-->    // closeFactorMantissa must be strictly greater than this value
        uint internal constant closeFactorMinMantissa = 0.05e18; // 0.05

@-->    // closeFactorMantissa must not exceed this value
        uint internal constant closeFactorMaxMantissa = 0.9e18; // 0.9
```

However this check is never implemented inside [_setCloseFactor](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1551):
```js
    function _setCloseFactor(
        uint newCloseFactorMantissa
    ) external returns (uint) {
        // Check caller is admin
        require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can set close factor");

        uint oldCloseFactorMantissa = closeFactorMantissa;
        closeFactorMantissa = newCloseFactorMantissa;
        emit NewCloseFactor(oldCloseFactorMantissa, closeFactorMantissa);

        return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }
```

## Weaponizing the Admin's Error
Someone could put forward an argument that this is just a cosmetic bound decided somewhat arbitrarily and even if the admin sets `closeFactorMantissa` to say `1e18` or `0.9999e18`, there's no harm. In fact the current tests use `closeFactorMantissa = 1e18`!

However that's not true. The following flow shows how an attack path emerges in such a scenario:
1. Bob has `15 ether` of debt which has gone underwater. Let's assume admin has correctly set `closeFactorMantissa = 0.9e18`.
2. Alice tries to maliciously liquidate Bob partially for amount of `14.99999 ether` so that a dust amount of leftover debt remains. This is allowed by the logic [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L993) and [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1135). As long as `current debt value > minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation`, partial liquidations are allowed. By doing so with many shortfall debts, she can flood the system with dust debts too unprofitable for anyone to liquidate, specially on a chain like Ethereum with high gas costs.
3. Alice's attempt is thwarted by the checks related to `maxClose` and `closeFactorMantissa`. She can't repay [more than 90% of the debt](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L108) in the worst case:
    - `maxClose` is [calculated by multiplying `borrowBalance` with `closeFactorMantissa`](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L605-L608)
    - [repayAmount > maxClose](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L609-L611) is not allowed by the protocol. 
4. Attack not possible because `closeFactorMantissa = 0.9e18`. But if it were `1e18`, she **could** have repaid `14.99999 ether` and the attack works.
5. With `closeFactorMantissa = 0.9e18`, the smallest leftover debt that can remain after an attacker's attempt is around `1 ether`. This is because the protocol implements the [minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation limit](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L85) of `10 ether` and partial repayment below this limit is not possible. So even if an attacker tries the attack when `borrowBalance = 10 ether + 1`, they will be able to repay only around `9 ether` and not more.

## Impact
Admin can inadvertently set it to values outside bounds and dilute/negate the protection mechanisms in place against avoidance of dust leftover debts. This issue is contingent on an admin error hence setting severity as medium.

## Mitigation 
```diff
    function _setCloseFactor(
        uint newCloseFactorMantissa
    ) external returns (uint) {
        // Check caller is admin
        require(msg.sender == admin, "only admin can set close factor");
+       require(newCloseFactorMantissa > closeFactorMinMantissa && newCloseFactorMantissa <= closeFactorMaxMantissa, "newCloseFactorMantissa outside limits");

        uint oldCloseFactorMantissa = closeFactorMantissa;
        closeFactorMantissa = newCloseFactorMantissa;
        emit NewCloseFactor(oldCloseFactorMantissa, closeFactorMantissa);

        return uint(Error.NO_ERROR);
    }
```
