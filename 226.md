# Incorrect use of L1 block.number on Arbitrum

### Summary

The `block.number` function in Arbitrum behaves differently from Ethereum, returning the approximate L1 block number at which the sequencer received the transaction instead of the actual L2 block number. This discrepancy can lead to issues when contracts rely on `block.number for timing or state updates.

### Root Cause

The function `block.number` in Arbitrum is synchronized with the L1 block number approximately once per minute. However, it does not reflect the actual L2 block progression. Instead, it provides a snapshot aligned with L1 block numbers, which average around 12 seconds per block. On Arbitrum, L2 blocks are generated more frequently, with an average time of 0.25 seconds per block.

This difference creates problems when developers use block.number as a timing mechanism or for state-dependent logic. Contracts relying on `block.number` assume consistent block time intervals, which is not true in Arbitrum’s case.

[example](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/arbitrum-vs-ethereum/block-numbers-and-time#example):

| Wall Clock time | 12:00 am | 12:00:15 am | 12:00:30 am | 12:00:45 am | 12:01 am | 12:01:15 am |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 block.number | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 |
| L2 block.number ¹ | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1000 | 1004 | 1004 |
| Arbitrum Block number (from RPCs) ² | 370000 | 370005 | 370006 | 370008 | 370012 | 370015 |

¹ L2 block.number: updated to sync with L1 block.number approximately every minute. Thus, over time, it will, like the L1 block.number, average to ~12 seconds per block.

² Arbitrum block number from RPCs: note that this can be updated multiple times per L1 block (this lets the sequencer give sub-L1-block-time transaction receipts.)

### Impact

This issue is likely to occur in any project deploying Ethereum-based smart contracts to Arbitrum without adapting for its unique block.number behavior. Many developers assume block.number increments uniformly across all EVM-compatible chains, leading to misconfigurations when migrating to L2s like Arbitrum.

Because of it, all time the functions that uses block.number are called on L2 chains, it can make problems. These issue directly affect the reliability and correctness of the protocol’s core functionalities, like, for example, the calculation of how many blocks has passed after the epoch start will be incorrect.

On Numa protocol, because of some verifications, this issue can result in a denial of service (DoS), rejecting good requests.

### PoC

The documentation says this codebase will be deployed in Arbitrum, Base and Ethereum. One time Base and Ethereum return block.number value as it owns chain block number and Arbitrum return approximately the L1 block number value, some functions that uses this number for verifications will act different. 

They directly call `block.number` and return as a value for blockNumber function in [NumaComptroller](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1930-L1932) and [CToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L241-L243) contracts.

```Solidity
function getBlockNumber() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
   return block.number;
}
```

Them, this value is used on this contract to make some verifications, like in [accrueInterest](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L418):

```Solidity
uint currentBlockNumber = getBlockNumber();
uint accrualBlockNumberPrior = accrualBlockNumber;

if (accrualBlockNumberPrior == currentBlockNumber) {
  return NO_ERROR;
}
```

And so many other functions:

### Mitigation

Consider using `ArbSys(100).arbBlockNumber()` to retrieve the L2 block number on Arbitrum.
