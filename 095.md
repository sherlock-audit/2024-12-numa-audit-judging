# user can send numa without paying fee by send small amount

### Summary

user can send numa without paying fee by send small amount .

### Root Cause

there is a fee set by numa so when user send numa they had to pay some fee, however a user can send numa without paying any fee due to division in the `_transferWithFee`  function result in rounding down to zero.

```solidity
function _transferWithFee(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee
    ) internal virtual {
        //@audit user can bypass pay fee by send small amount 
        uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 10000;
        amount -= amountToBurn;
        _burn(from, amountToBurn);
        super._transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

let assume the fee is 1% ~ 100 in bps and amount is 99.

uint256 amountToBurn = (amount * fee) / 10000;

amountToBurn = (99*100)/ 10000 = 0.99 

but in solidity using chisel 

```js
➜ (uint256(99) * uint256(100) )/ 10000
Type: uint256
├ Hex: 0x0
├ Hex (full word): 0x0
└ Decimal: 0
```


### Internal pre-conditions

admin set fee to 1%

### External pre-conditions

user send any amount that will result in rounding down to zero.

### Attack Path

user want to send 1000 numa ,

fee is 1% when user send all the 1000 numa the final amount user will end with is 990.

a user will send 99 numa *10 times* then send 10 numa *total* 1000 numa so he will not pay any fee.

### Impact

lose of fee for the protocol. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

revert if the fee > 0 and amountToBurn is equal to 0.
