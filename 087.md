# There is no max decrease in buy_fee_PID, allowing it to be manipulated easily

### Summary

In `updateBuyFeePID()`, when the pid is to be increased, there is a maximum increase in the PID allowed per 4 hours:
```solidity
if (((buy_fee_PID - buyPIDXhrAgo) > buyPID_incMaxRate)) {
    //does change exceed max rate over Xhrs?
    buy_fee_PID = buyPIDXhrAgo + buyPID_incMaxRate; //cap to max rate over 4hrs
}
```

However this does not exist when decreasing the pid. 

This allows the PID to be atomically decreased to zero, by repeatedly buying NUMA and then selling/burning it.

If buying X NUMA triggers the max PID increase:

Anyone can buy more than X NUMA, and then sell it. This will cause the buy_fee_PID to decrease upon the sell, by a greater amount than it had increased. Alternatively rather than selling they can also use the NUMA to mint a nuAsset to have the same effect on the buy_fee_PID.

Repeating this allows the PID to be decreased to zero, allowing for much cheaper vault buys of NUMA.



### Root Cause

There is no maximum decrease in the PID

### Internal pre-conditions

`buyPID_incTriggerPct` > `buyPID_decTriggerPct` is required

The protocol team has stated that this is a valid state

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`buy_fee_PID` can be atomically manipulated

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Similar to the `buyPID_incMaxRate`, also enforce ` buyPID_decMaxRate`
