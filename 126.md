# Potential DoS Vulnerability in accrueInterest Function Due to Unrestricted Calls

### Summary

The accrueInterest function in the contract is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to call it repeatedly. Since the function involves computationally intensive operations such as interest rate calculations, external contract calls, and state updates, it may be exploited by malicious users to cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS). By spamming the function, an attacker could exhaust gas resources, delay essential state updates, or congest the network, disrupting protocol operations.

### Root Cause

```javascript 
  function accrueInterest() public virtual override returns (uint) {
        /* Remember the initial block number */
        uint currentBlockNumber = getBlockNumber();
        uint accrualBlockNumberPrior = accrualBlockNumber;
        /* Short-circuit accumulating 0 interest */
        if (accrualBlockNumberPrior == currentBlockNumber) {
            return NO_ERROR;
        }

        /* Read the previous values out of storage */
        // NUMALENDING
        // interest rate is based on lending contract cash & vault available to borrow
        uint maxBorrowableAmountFromVault;
        if (address(vault) != address(0))
            maxBorrowableAmountFromVault = vault.getMaxBorrow();

        uint cashPrior = getCashPrior() + maxBorrowableAmountFromVault;
        uint borrowsPrior = totalBorrows;
        uint reservesPrior = totalReserves;
        uint borrowIndexPrior = borrowIndex;
```
Here the function is public instead of internal, this opens up a way for malicious users to force the contract to compute interest by repeated calls

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Repeated calls to accrueInterest can lead to block gas limits being hit, delaying or preventing the processing of critical transactions within the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the function internal or only vault can call it
