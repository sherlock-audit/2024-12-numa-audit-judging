# The deposit calls can silently fail leading to incorrect accounting for distributed deposits in NumaVault contract

***Summary:***
The developer has failed to check if the low-level call is successful or not by emitting a conditional logic check. That is the function will not revert and the function call will succeed even if the low-level call should fail.

***POC:***
In the examples above, the contract accepts deposits by calling the DepositFromVault(uint256) function via a call and ABI signature. To call this function, it uses the low-level call() operation, without checking the return value in this case. Thus, it is possible for the call to silently fail, possibly leading to incorrect accounting for distributed deposits.

***Mitigation:***
```diff
+   (bool success1, ) = rwd_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", rwd));
+   require(success1, "Deposit failed");
-   rwd_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", rwd));

+   (bool success2, ) = fee_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)",feeAmount)); 
+   require(success2, "Deposit failed");
-   fee_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)",feeAmount));

+   (bool success3, ) = fee_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", feeAmount));
+   require(success3, "Deposit failed");
-   fee_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", feeAmount));

+   (bool success4, ) = rwd_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", extractedRwdFromDebt));
+   require(success4, "Deposit failed");
-   rwd_address.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("DepositFromVault(uint256)", extractedRwdFromDebt));
```
In the revised calls above, the NumaVault contract now captures and checks the return values of its low-level calls to ensure that deposits were properly distributed, before proceeding with any additional logic.
