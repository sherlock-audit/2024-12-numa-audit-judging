# Borrowers can benefit from liquidations rather than avoiding them.

### Summary

The borrowers can profit from liquidations due to unaccounted interest accumulation in the liquidation calculations.



### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in the interaction between interest accrual and liquidation mechanisms in `CToken`, allowing borrowers to profit from their own liquidations.(  the liquidation process through `liquidateBorrowFresh `fetches the borrower's balance and debt to calculate liquidation amounts).
[function liquidateBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L901)
```solidity
function accrueInterest() public virtual override returns (uint) {
    uint interestAccumulated = mul_ScalarTruncate(simpleInterestFactor, borrowsPrior);
    uint totalBorrowsNew = interestAccumulated + borrowsPrior;
}

function liquidateBorrowFresh(address liquidator, address borrower, uint repayAmount, CTokenInterface cTokenCollateral)

function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
    uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
    uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) / _totalSupply;
}
```
When a position is created, the borrower's debt is tracked in `borrowBalanceStoredInternal`, As time passes, interest accumulates through `accrueInterest`, which updates the global `borrowIndex `but doesn't automatically update individual positions.

The issue lies in how the protocol handles interest accumulation during liquidations. While `liquidateBorrowInternal `calls `accrueInterest `for both borrowed asset and collateral, the exchange rate calculations in `exchangeRateStoredInternal `don't immediately reflect these updates( as mentioned in the comment above the function). This creates a discrepancy where `seizeToken `calculations use partially updated state.

However, `comptroller.liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens`, which determines collateral seizure based on exchange rates that may not fully account for accumulated interest.

This leads to a situation where the liquidation process seizes less collateral than necessary to cover the actual debt position. The borrower retains excess collateral that can be redeemed for more assets than they had pre-liquidation.

As far As the concern occur , liquidations will not be executed twice in a row and if they are, they are also less likely to be in the same block. The reason they will not liquidate twice is because it is not profitable, only dust will be left.
