# `NumaOracle` incorrectly retrieves the invert price of what is supposed during `getV3SqrtHighestPrice` and `getV3SqrtLowestPrice`..

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

In `NumaOracle` ,`NUMA/USDC` which is deployed in Arbitruma and can be found [here](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x804aC8929612C34C9D218db133F18343D03618A1#readContract) is used as price oracle for reading the price of `NUMA` in terms of `USDC`. However, `NumaOracle` when it is reading the `TWAP` price and it wants the lowest price meaning the `lowest amount of USDC for 1 NUMA` is getting the invert of that meaning the `highest amount of USDC for 1 NUMA`. And vice versa in the highest price. Let's see the vulnerable function :

```solidity
    function getV3SqrtLowestPrice(
        address _uniswapV3Pool,
        uint32 _intervalShort,
        uint32 _intervalLong
    ) public view returns (uint160) {
        require(
            _intervalLong > _intervalShort,
            "intervalLong must be longer than intervalShort"
        );

        uint160 sqrtPriceX96;

        //Spot price of the token
        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96Spot, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool)
            .slot0();

        //TWAP prices for short and long intervals
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96Short = getV3SqrtPriceAvg(
            _uniswapV3Pool,
            _intervalShort
        );
        uint160 sqrtPriceX96Long = getV3SqrtPriceAvg(
            _uniswapV3Pool,
            _intervalLong
        );

        //Takes the lowest token price denominated in token
        //Condition checks to see if token is in denominator of pair, ie: token1/token0
        if (IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool).token0() == token) {
@>            sqrtPriceX96 = (
                sqrtPriceX96Long >= sqrtPriceX96Short
                    ? sqrtPriceX96Long
                    : sqrtPriceX96Short
            );

            // comparing to spot price with numaLPspotPrice*(1+maxSpotOffsetBps)
            // inverted because numa price is 1/sqrtPriceX96
            uint160 sqrtPriceX96SpotModified = (sqrtPriceX96Spot * 10000) /
@>                maxSpotOffsetPlus1SqrtBps;

@>            sqrtPriceX96 = (
                sqrtPriceX96 >= sqrtPriceX96SpotModified
                    ? sqrtPriceX96
                    : sqrtPriceX96SpotModified
            );
        } else {
           // ...
        }
        return sqrtPriceX96;
    }
```

We care only for the part where `IUniswapV3Pool(_uniswapV3Pool).token0() == token` since in `NUMA` is the `token0` in the deployed pool. Since `NUMA` is `token0` in the deployed pool, that means that `sqrtPriceX96` shows how many USDC goes for 1 NUMA in the given TWAP period. So when we say we want the lowest price of NUMA in USDC terms, we **want the lowest sqrtPriceX96 `meaning the less USDC for 1 NUMA`. However, as it is seen in the highlighted parts, it is actually taking the highest price instead of the lowest. The same is happening on the `getV3SqrtHighestPrice`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Medium. The impact of this vulnerability is that the invert price will be returned to the protocol from what is expected and this will influence the calculations in the `NumaPrinter` which is responsible for the conversion between `numa` and `nuAsset`.
