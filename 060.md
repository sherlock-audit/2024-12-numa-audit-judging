# Invariant violation leading to DoS'd borrows

### Summary

See 'Root Cause'

### Root Cause

The contest README states the following invariant:
> Protocol cannot lend when CF_liquid < 20%, where CF_liquid = rETH_vault / synthetic_rETHdebt.

However, the code uses 200% mistakenly:
```solidity
    uint public cf_liquid_warning = 2000; // 200%
```

### Impact

In [`getMaxBorrow()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L737), the `synthValueWithCF` will be calculated to be much higher than what it should be. This causes `getMaxBorrow()` to return `0`, causing a DoS for borrowing.
