# Liquidator may end up receiving no seizeTokens and lose all repayAmount

## Summary
During liquidation the protocol calculates the amount of cTokens to seize or `seizeTokens` like [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L1008-L1009). There is however 
- no check throughout the liquidation flow to verify if `seizeTokens > 0`. 
    - Note that `seizeTokens = 0` is possible because the calculation rounds down in favour of the borrower, not the liquidator [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1458) and [here](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1510).
- no slippage control param (for example, minAmountExpected) which the liquidator can specify while calling the liquidate functions.

This can result in the liquidator ending up paying `repayAmount` and reducing the borrower's debt but not receiving anything in return.

## Description
Imagine the following:
1. Numa per cNuma = 2e8 (as per current rates observable in tests)
2. rEth per Numa = 1_000_000e18 (Numa has appreciated considerably in future)
3. Bob has borrowed `0.18e18 rEth`. This is equivalent to `18e10 Numa` which turns out to be `900 cNuma`
4. Alice wants to liquidate Bob's unhealthy debt and calls `liquidateBadDebt()` with `_percentagePosition1000` as `1`. This denotes `0.1%` of debt to be liquidated. Note that this works similarly in a regular non-bad debt (just shortfall) situation too - the calls to the other liquidate functions need a repayAmount param instead of a percentage param, based on which a ratio is calculated and `seizeTokens` are calculated ( _See inside [liquidateCalculateSeizeTokens()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1510)_ ).
5. rEth amount equal to `0.18e15` is pulled from Alice's account to commence liquidation
6. In return [she gets](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L1458): `seizeTokens = 1 * 900 / 1000 = 0`.
7. No further checks revert due to this and the liquidation flow concludes.

Note that such a situation can happen inadvertently during periods of high volatility too. Alice may have calculated correctly prior to sending her tx so that she receives non-zero seizeTokens but by the time the tx executes, price movement could well rob her of any returns.

## Impact
Liquidator can end up paying `repayAmount` and reducing the borrower's debt but not receiving anything in return.

## Recommendation 
- Add verification for `seizeTokens > 0`. 
- Add a slippage control param (for example, minAmountExpected) which a liquidator can specify while calling the liquidate functions.
