# liquidator will seize full collateral while repaying very less

### Summary

when liquidators call liquidatebaddebt they can specify percentage of position to liquidate 

    function liquidateBadDebt(
        address _borrower,
        uint _percentagePosition1000,
        CNumaToken collateralToken
    ) external whenNotPaused notBorrower(_borrower) {
        require(
            (_percentagePosition1000 > 0 && _percentagePosition1000 <= 1000),
            "percentage"
        );

then the repay amount is calculated as     

    uint repayAmount = (borrowAmountFull * _percentagePosition1000) / 1000;

and then this amount is transferred from the liquidator

        SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
            underlyingBorrow,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            repayAmount
        );
however there is no validation check to ensure the transfered amount is equal to the repay amount the borrower can specify any percentage and seize the full collateral while repaying very less
in the seize tokens calculation the amount liquidator will recieve is calculated as

    function liquidateBadDebtCalculateSeizeTokensAfterRepay(
        address cTokenCollateral,
        address borrower,
        uint percentageToTake
    ) external view override returns (uint, uint) {
        /*
         * Get the exchange rate and calculate the number of collateral tokens to seize:
         * for bad debt liquidation, we take % of amount repaid as % of collateral seized
         *  seizeAmount = (repayAmount / borrowBalance) * collateralAmount
         *  seizeTokens = seizeAmount / exchangeRate
         *
         */


        (, uint tokensHeld, , ) = CToken(cTokenCollateral).getAccountSnapshot(
            borrower
        );
        uint seizeTokens = (percentageToTake * tokensHeld) / (1000);
        return (uint(Error.NO_ERROR), seizeTokens);
    }

if liquidator specifies he wants to liquidate the full position by setting percentage to take as 1000 he will get full collateral
