# Updating `last_lsttokenvalueWei` when LST token value decreases will cause unfair reward accruals

### Summary

Updating `last_lsttokenvalueWei` when LST token value decreases will cause unfair reward accruals, causing loss to NUMA holders.

### Root Cause

Upon extracting rewards, in `extractInternal()`, `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is set to `currentvalueWei`.

However, it could be the case that `currentValueWei < last_lsttokenvalueWei`, since the price feed values can fluctuate.

In such cases, the last token value should not be updated, as it means that when the lst value goes back up, rewards are incorrectly accrued on this increase. 

Note that the official exchange rates (which represent accrued staking rewards) of LSTs with ETH are monotonically increasing. However, the price feed with ETH may fluctuate up and down, causing this issue. 

### Internal pre-conditions

`rwd_threshold` = 0 (as it currently is)

### External pre-conditions

LST/ETH price feed value decreases. This is common and can be seen [here](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/reth-eth) in the rETH/ETH chart

### Attack Path

1. Price feed values LST at 1.05e18
2. After an update, Price feed values LST at 1.1e18 (so rewards are accrued)
3. After an update, Price feed values LST at 1.05e18 again
4. `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is updated to 1.05e18
5. Then, the price feed values LST at 1.1e18 (rewards are accrued over the same price increase, twice)

Even though the staking rewards have not increased, price fluctuation paired with the incorrect accounting has made it seem like rewards have accrued twice. This extracts extra value from rETH depositors / NUMA holders. 

### Impact

Extra rewards are accrued, causing de-valuing of NUMA -> loss to NUMA holders.

### Mitigation

In [`NumaVault.extractInternal()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L349), If `currentValueWei` < `last_lsttokenvalueWei`, don't update `last_lsttokenvalueWei`

This ensures that staking rewards are not double-accounted
