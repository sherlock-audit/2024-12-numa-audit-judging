# The entire NumaVault can be DoS'd permanently due to underflow

### Summary

Due to inconsistent accounting when repaying debt to the vault, the NumaVault can be DoS'd permanently, causing loss of all rETH deposited.

### Root Cause

The vault has a `debt` variable, and a `rewardsFromDebt` variable. 

`rewardsFromDebt` is incremented whenever extracting rewards, regardless of whether `rwd_address == address(0)` or not:

```solidity
rewardsFromDebt += rwdDebt;
if (rwd_address != address(0)) {
    // other logic
}
```

However, when repaying debt, `rewardsFromDebt` is only decremented when `rwd_address != address(0)`.
```solidity
if ((extractedRwdFromDebt > 0) && (rwd_address != address(0))) {
    rewardsFromDebt -= extractedRwdFromDebt;

    // other code //
}

debt = debt - _amount;
```

Due to this, `rewardsFromDebt` can be incremented, and then `debt` can be reduced below `rewardsFromDebt` upon repayment.

This causes the `debt - rewardsFromDebt` to underflow and revert, causing a DoS of the entire vault, since it is called in [`rewardsValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L339) which is called by all major flows (buy, sell, etc).

### Internal pre-conditions

Precondition: `rwd_address==address(0)`

`rwd_address` is an optional variable in the protocol, as the protocol clearly intends to be able to function with `rwd_address=address(0)`. This is evident as `rwd_address!=address(0)` is always checked before performing transferring tokens to the `rwd_address`. For example [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L359) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L798)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker borrows from cLST such that some funds are borrowed from the `NumaVault` (not needed if `debt` is already > 0)
2. Some amount of rewards accrue, [increasing `rewardsFromDebt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L358) (not needed if `rewardsFromDebt` is already > 0)
3. Attacker repays all the debt, so that `debt == 0`, but `rewardsFromDebt > 0`

Now the NumaVault is completely DoS'd. 

### Impact

The NumaVault is completely DoS'd, so the rETH stored in it is stuck forever, causing severe loss to NUMA holders and the protocol as a whole. This DOS also means that remaining cLST borrows cannot be liquidated, leading to bad debt.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One fix would be to force `rwd_address` to be set upon initialisation, instead of requiring it to be later set via `setRwdAddress()`
