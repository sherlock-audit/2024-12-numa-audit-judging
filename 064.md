# Interest charged to borrower even when protocol is paused

## Description
[accrueInterest()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L450-L462) only takes into account the `blockDelta` which is `currentBlockNumber - accrualBlockNumberPrior` for calculating the interest payable by a borrower. It unfairly includes any duration of time for which the protocol was paused when the borrower couldn't have repaid even if they wanted to.

- Let's say Alice borrowed on a leveraged strategy on Monday at 2:00 PM
- At 2:05 PM the protocol gets paused
- Alice is now unable to repay until the protocol is unpaused since the call to `closeLeverageStrategy()` [internally calls](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L322) `vault.repayLeverage(true)` and [repayLeverage is protected](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1267) by the `whenNotPaused` modifier.
- According to the code, interest continues accruing during this period
- When unpaused on Tuesday at 2:05 PM, Alice would owe a full day's interest

**_NOTE: It's interesting to observe_** that while `closeLeverageStrategy()` has `whenNotPaused`, the regular [repayBorrow()](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/CErc20.sol#L104) is allowed to operate even when the protocol is paused, showing the inconsistency in code implementation.

## Impact
Borrowers unfairly pay interest even for the paused duration when they did not have the power to repay and close their debts.

## Mitigation
Interest accrual should be suspended during paused periods.
