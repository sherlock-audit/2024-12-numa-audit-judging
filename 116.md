# Bad debt accumulation impacting late withdrawers

### Summary

The `Numa protocol` exhibits a critical vulnerability in its lending system wich is  Bad debt accumulation disproportionately affects late withdrawers, it's true that  the bad debt is handled but don't specifically prevent the uneven distribution between early and late withdrawers.

### Root Cause

The bad debt distribution issue manifests through [exchangeRateStoredInternal's](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numaauditkomane007/blob/534bdde07b663b69bdb5e4c8be212fcefab80843/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L379) calculation: (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) * expScale / totalSupply. Early withdrawers receive full value based on current exchange rates, while later withdrawers face deteriorated rates that absorb accumulated bad debt. This creates a first-mover advantage where informed users can extract full value, leaving remaining users to bear disproportionate losses.
This issue can be shown like : 
```solidity
function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
    uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
    if (_totalSupply == 0) {
        return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
    } else {
        uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
        uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
        uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) / _totalSupply;
        return exchangeRate;
    }
}
```
When users redeem their tokens: 
```solidity
function redeemFresh() {
    // Amount calculation uses current exchange rate
    redeemAmount = mul_ScalarTruncate(exchangeRate, redeemTokensIn);
}
```
This creates a "first out" advantage because: 
1- Early withdrawers get full value based on current exchange rate.
2- Last users face an exchange rate that absorbs all accumulated bad debt.

We can demonstrate this as : 
```solidity
// First user withdraws at good rate
cNuma.redeem(firstUserTokens);  // Gets full value

// Bad debt accumulates
vault.liquidateLstBorrower(userA, type(uint256).max, true, true);

// Last user withdraws at worse rate
cNuma.redeem(lastUserTokens);   // Gets reduced value due to accumulated bad debt
```

### Impact

Huge fund loss for the users last to withdraw.
Early withdrawers effectively steal from the late withdrawers


### Mitigation

Socialise the loss among all users.
