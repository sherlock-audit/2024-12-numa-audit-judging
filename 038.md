# OracleUtils.ethLeftSide() is not correct for some tokens, leading to incorrect nuAsset pricing

### Summary

[`OracleUtils::ethLeftSide()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/libraries/OracleUtils.sol#L261-L270) is used to check whether ETH is in the numerator or the denominator of the price feed, in order to correctly price the paired asset.

The check is implemented incorrectly, causing incorrect pricing of assets in some cases.

### Root Cause

The function [`OracleUtils::ethLeftSide()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/libraries/OracleUtils.sol#L261-L270) checks the first 3 characters of the pricefeed’s description string, and checks if they are “ETH”. If so, it assumes that the numerator is ETH. 

The issue is that there are assets which have “ETH” as the first 3 characters, but are not ETH. An example is the LST, Stader ETHx. 

It has a [price feed on Arbitrum Mainnet](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/ethx-eth-exchange-rate), denominated in ETH, with the description string “ETHx/ETH”.

Even though ETH is on the right side, the `ethLeftSide()` function will return `true`, which is incorrect.

This causes the asset to be priced incorrectly in the `NumaPrinter`, since it assumes that the asset is ETH.

> This **should be able to theoretically mint any asset with a chainlink (18 decimals)**, including RWA assets.

> This could be assets like currencies (nuUSD, nuEUR, etc), commodities (nuGOLD, nuOIL, etc), **other cryptocurrencies** (nuETH, nuBTC), and stocks (nuTSLA, nuNVDA, etc)

### Internal pre-conditions

An asset like ETHx is used as a nuAsset

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

nuAssets can be priced incorrectly in some cases

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check the first 4 bytes of the pricefeed's description string, and return true only if the first 4 bytes are the same as “ETH/”
This ensures that the function is always correct
