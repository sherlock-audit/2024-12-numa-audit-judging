# incomplete conversion from $NUMA to ETH and vice versa which could result in

### Root Cause

[VaultManager::numaToEth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L759C1-L777C6) and [VaultManager::ethToNuma()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L782C1-L800C6) are the functions responsible for converting ETH to $NUMA and from $NUMA to ETH as the name suggests. 

```solidity
    function numaToEth(
        uint _inputAmount,
        PriceType _t
    ) public view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = getSynthScaling();
        uint result = numaToToken( 
            _inputAmount,
            1 ether,
            1 ether,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );

        if (_t == PriceType.BuyPrice) {
            result = (result * 1 ether) / getBuyFee();
        } else if (_t == PriceType.SellPrice) {
            (uint sellfee, , ) = getSellFeeScaling();
            result = (result * sellfee) / 1 ether;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
In numaToEth(), we can see that $NUMA is first and foremost converted to LSTs, like rETH. The sell fee is applied appropriately, but then the LST isn't converted to ETH. This led to the assumption that the function assumes an exchange rate of 1:1 between LSTs and ETH, which is not the case. LSTs are staking tokens that accrue staking rewards, which makes the exchange rate of LST to ETH disproportionate. The same applies to ethToNuma(). Currently, 1 rETH can be exchanged for more than 1 ETH.  This means that in the conversion of eth to $NUMA, the function assumes the ETH == rETH, and the resulting $NUMA amount is overstated. In the same light, the resulting amount of ETH calculated in $NUMA to ETH is understated.

If you look into NumaOracle, you will find that the result (rETH) is converted to eth using the INumaTokenToEthConverter.

`NumaPrinter::getNbOfNuAssetFromNuma()` and `NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee()` invoke `VaultManager::numaToEth()` and `VaultManager::ethToNuma()` respectively. This means that the ETH value of the $NUMA token in the vault, considering its nominal price, is contrasted with the lowest or highest prices of LP15, LP30, and the LP spot price. During the minting of nuAsset, where the lowest price is utilized, the ethToNuma function might yield an exaggerated amount of $NUMA since the ETH is not first converted to rETH (LST). Using this logic, since the price (or value) returned is overstated and higher than the LP15, LP30, and LP spot prices, it will lead to the wrong price being applied during the minting process.

### Impact
When we are minting nuAsset, and the actual price of the ETH to NUMA from the vault is less than that of the oracle prices, the user receives less than they are entitled to due to an overstated price and the oracle price being used, and vice versa.

### PoC

### Mitigation
convert the LST to ETH and vice versa in `VaultManager::numaToEth()` and `VaultManager::ethToNuma()`
