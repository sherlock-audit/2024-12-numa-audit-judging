# Use of deprecated Chainlink variable could cause reverts when interacting with the oracle

### Summary

## Summary
`tokenToEth` method performs a require check against a deprecated chainlink variable which does not always return a meaningful value.
## Description
Let's have a look at `OracleUtils.tokenToEth`
```solidity
     */
    function tokenToEth(
        uint256 _amount,
        address _pricefeed,
        uint128 _chainlink_heartbeat,
        uint256 _decimals
    ) public view checkSequencerActive returns (uint256 EthValue) {
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 price,
            ,
            uint256 timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound // @note deprecated variable
        ) = AggregatorV3Interface(_pricefeed).latestRoundData();
    }

** SNIP** 

        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Answer given before round");
```
It fetches info using `latestRoundData` and performs a sanity check between `answeredInRound` and `roundID`. However, the Chainlink team have stated that [`answeredInRound` had been deprecated](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference) and have left the following message when fetching the variable off their contracts directly on etherscan
>>(Only some AggregatorV3Interface implementations return meaningful values)

In cases where a pricefeed does not return `answeredInRound` correctly, `tokenToEth` will always revert.

### Root Cause

- [`OracleUtils.ethToToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/libraries/OracleUtils.sol#L61-L62) uses a deprecated variable

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Asset uses Chainlink pricefeed that does not return a meaningful value

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, logic error

### Impact

- DoS
- unexpected behaviour

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't rely on deprecated variables when performing sanity checks.
