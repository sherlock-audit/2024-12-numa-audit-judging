# Stale price used across `NumaVault`

### Summary

## Description
Price is updated only once every 24 hours and result is used as a reference across numerous core functions in the vault. Sudden price swings within a day won't be reflected, resulting in unfair arbitrage opportunities at the expense of the Numa protocol and its' users.

Let's observe [historical price movements of rETH.](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rocket-pool-eth). We can see that there are instances where its' price swings more than 10% within a 24-hour chart, e.g on December 23-24. Let's have a look at `extractRewardsNoRequire` which is responsible for updating `last_lsttokenvalueWei`
```solidity
    function extractRewardsNoRequire() internal {
        if (block.timestamp >= (last_extracttimestamp + 24 hours)) { // @audit callable only once every 24 hours
            (
                uint256 rwd,
                uint256 currentvalueWei,
                uint256 rwdDebt
            ) = rewardsValue();
            if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
                extractInternal(rwd, currentvalueWei, rwdDebt);
            }
        }
    }
```
From the code we observe that the method can be called at most once a day. In the downtime period, no logic will be executed, price won't be checked and the vault will operate with the last reported price. From the charts we saw that 5-10% price deviations on a daily basis are not uncommon which creates unfair arbitrage scenarios, for example:
1. `last_lsttokenvalueWei` logs rETH priced at 4000$ and goes on cooldown
2. rETH increases to 4400$ market price
3. Numa holders see this, sell their Numa to the vault at reference lst price 4000$, sell their lst for 4400$ and deposit at the same reference price once more, pocketing the difference as profit.

### Root Cause

- In [`NumaVault.extractRewardsNoRequire`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L376-L377) is callable only once every 24-hours

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

- `last_lsttokenvalueWei` is updated and `extractRewardsNoRequire` goes on 24-hour cooldown
- Price swings significantly as described in the summary

### Attack Path

1. `last_lsttokenvalueWei` logs rETH priced at 4000$ and goes on cooldown
2. rETH increases to 4400$ market price
3. Numa holders see this, sell their Numa to the vault at reference lst price 4000$, sell their lst for 4400$ and deposit at the same reference price once more, pocketing the difference as profit.

### Impact

- protocol can be gamed
- loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't rely on reference prices, call the oracle instead.
