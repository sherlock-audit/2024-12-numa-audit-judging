# Risk of overpayment due to race condition between repayBorrowFresh and liquidateBorrowFresh.

### Summary

The `Numa `protocol has a critical race condition vulnerability between `repayBorrowFresh` and `liquidateBorrowFresh` 
transactions that can lead to double payment scenarios.

### Root Cause

The issue arises when a borrower sends a transaction to repay their debt position when it becomes `liquidatable`, but a `liquidateBorrowFresh `transaction is executed just before the user's `repayBorrowFresh `transaction.

The main entry points that can lead to this race condition are:

[repayBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L794)() - Called by users directly repaying their loans
[repayBorrowBehalfInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L805)() - Called by third parties repaying on behalf of borrowers
[liquidateBorrowInternal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/CToken.sol#L901C14-L901C37)() - Called by liquidators

```solidity
// In CToken.sol
function liquidateBorrowFresh(...) {
    // First repayment happens here
    uint actualRepayAmount = repayBorrowFresh(liquidator, borrower, repayAmount);
    // Seizes collateral
    require(cTokenCollateral.seize(liquidator, borrower, seizeTokens) == NO_ERROR, "token seizure failed");
}

function repayBorrowFresh(...) {
    // Second repayment happens here
    uint accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrowsPrev - actualRepayAmount;
    accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;
}
```
All these functions ultimately flow through to `repayBorrowFresh`, which handles the actual debt reduction logic. The critical path occurs in `liquidateBorrowFresh` where it calls `repayBorrowFresh `internally before seizing collateral. This creates a window where a user's direct repayment transaction could execute after the liquidation has already processed a repayment.

The state changes happen in `repayBorrowFresh` where the borrower's debt is reduced:

```solidity
uint accountBorrowsNew = accountBorrowsPrev - actualRepayAmount;
accountBorrows[borrower].principal = accountBorrowsNew;
```


If a user's `repayBorrowFresh` executes after `liquidateBorrowFresh` but before the transaction is mined, they will process another repayment against their already-reduced debt balance. This results in the borrower paying twice - once through the liquidation and once through their direct repayment.

### Internal pre-conditions

Looking at `CToken.sol`, the race condition can occur naturally, legitimate bots running liquidation operations and regular users trying to save their positions will naturally tend to submit transactions around the same time. The race condition emerges from this normal, expected behavior rather than from any malicious exploitation.
