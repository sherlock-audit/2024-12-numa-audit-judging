# Lack of Verification for Authorized Minting in NumaPrinter

### Summary

The function mintAssetFromNumaInput in NumaPrinter.sol (line 507) fails to verify whether the caller is authorized to mint assets. This oversight allows any address to mint assets from the contract as long as they meet the input requirements. This could lead to unauthorized minting of assets, causing significant financial losses or exploitation of the system.

### Root Cause

In NumaMinter.sol a mapping is declared for allowed minters of NumaTokens
```javascript
contract NumaMinter is Ownable2Step {
    //
    INuma public numa;
    mapping(address => bool) allowedMinters;
```
This mapping is declared but not enforced
