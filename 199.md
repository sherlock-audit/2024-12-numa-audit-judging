# Buy fee PID is updated with wrong amounts leading to unexpected fee growth

### Summary

## Summary
`updateBuyFeePID` is invoked with Numa amount before fee, instead of the actual numa that was minted
## Description
Let's take a look at the Numa `buy` flow.
```solidity
        uint256 numaAmount = vaultManager.tokenToNuma( // calculates how much numa we get for input amount reth
            _inputAmount,
            last_lsttokenvalueWei,
            decimals,
            _criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );

        require(numaAmount > 0, "amount of numa is <= 0");
        if (_transferREth) {                          // transfers the reth
            SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(
                lstToken,
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                _inputAmount
            );
        }
        uint fee = vaultManager.getBuyFee();
        if (feeWhitelisted[msg.sender]) {
            fee = 1 ether; // max percent (= no fee)
        }
        _numaOut = (numaAmount * fee) / 1 ether;       // applies buy fee
        require(_numaOut >= _minNumaAmount, "Min NUMA");
        minterContract.mint(_receiver, _numaOut);      // mint amount after fee
```
Buyers send their desired rETH which is exchanged for Numa and a buy fee is subtrtacted directly from the Numa they are owed. However at the end of the function, `updateBuyFeePID` is called in order to update the future buy fee of numa since supply increased.

```solidity
        vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(numaAmount, true); // @audit-issue called with amount pre-tax
```

However the update function is invoked with `numaAmount` which is the number before the buy fee is applied. This is incorrect since the actual minted amount is smaller than what the `updateBuyFeePID` is called with. For instance, we send rETH to get 100 NUMA tokens, fee = 10%, we will get minted 90 NUMA tokens, however the vault manager will be updated as if 100 NUMA tokens were minted. 

Let's have an example with a fee whitelisted user - they will pay no fees so `_numaOut = numaAmount`. If a whitelisted user deposits rETH to get 100 NUMA tokens, they will get minted 100 NUMA tokens and will invoke `updateBuyFeePID` with the 100 minted NUMA. Both users influenced the buy fee PID by 100 NUMA, however they got minted different amounts.

Further proof validating this issue can be seen in `sell` where `updateBuyFeePID` is invoked with the actual amount of Numa that was burnt, meaning that the amounts that are minted/burnt should be used in updating fee PID.
```solidity
        numa.burn(_numaAmount);
        
        vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
    
```

### Root Cause

- In [`NumaVault.buyNoMax`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L527), `updateBuyFeePID` is invoked with wrong, inflated amount instead of the actual numa that was minted

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none, wrong logic

### Impact

- wrong fee calculation
- loss for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Invoke `updateBuyFeePID` with the actual minted amount in `NumaVault.buyNoMax`
