# Minting and burning nuAssets can be repeated to atomically reduce buy_fee_PID to zero

### Summary

Minting nuAssets and burning nuAssets both call `vaultManager.updateBuyFeePid()` based on the NUMA amount minted or burned. 

However, both of these use the `vaultBuy=false` parameter (since they are not vault buys), which causes them to reduce the `buy_fee_PID`.

This allows anyone to repeat minting and burning a nuAsset (delta-neutral) to reduce the buy_fee_PID to `0`

```solidity
vaultManager.updateBuyFeePID(_numaAmount, false);
```
(The above logic is used in both `mintNuAsset()` and [`burnNuAssetFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L198))

### Root Cause

Calling `vaultManager.updateBuyFeePid()` will decrease the `buy_fee_PID` in both cases.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Burn NUMA to mint a nuAsset
2. Mint NUMA by burning the nuAsset
3. Repeat the above steps until `buy_fee_PID` is equal to zero
4. Now, in the same transaction, we can liquidate many rETH borrowers since the vault buy price of NUMA has decreased significantly

### Impact

`buy_fee_PID` can be atomically reduced to `0`

Liquidation conditions can be achieved atomically, and the attacker can profit via the liquidation bonus
