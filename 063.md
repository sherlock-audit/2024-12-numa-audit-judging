# Removal of closeFactorMantissa & maxClose constraints in deprecated markets allows attack vector to worsen protocol's health

## Summary
In a deprecated market, the `closeFactorMantissa` & `maxClose` constraints are not applied and the [only check active is](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/lending/NumaComptroller.sol#L579-L583) whether `borrowBalance >= repayAmount`. This allows the following attack vectors:

1. Malicious user partially liquidates a shortfall debt position just enough to push it into a `badDebt` position.

2. Malicious user partially liquidates a shortfall debt position just enough to leave behind dust amount of unhealthy debt which would be unprofitable for others to liquidate due to gas costs, specially on chains like Ethereum.

## Description
Here are the flows:

### Attack Vector 1 ( _push into badDebt territory_ )
**Setup:**
- Bob has borrowed 40 ETH worth against collateral of 50 ETH worth. 85% LTV is allowed.
- Liquidation incentive is 12%.
- Price movement causes Bob borrow to be worth 45 ETH, making it eligible for liquidation by Alice.

1. **IF** `closeFactorMantissa` of `0.9e18` or `90%` was applicable here, Alice would have at best:
    - Liquidated a max `90% * 45 = 40.5 ETH` of debt.
    - Received `12% * 40.5 = 4.86 ETH` of liquidation incentive.
    - Remaining debt = `45 - 40.5 = 4.5 ETH` and remaining collateral = `50 - 40.5 - 4.86 = 4.64 ETH`. 
    - New LTV = `100 * 4.5 / 4.64 = 96.98%`. 
    - Also, the remaining debt is less than the [minBorrowAmountAllowPartialLiquidation limit](https://github.com/NumaMoney/Numa/blob/c6476d828f556967e64410b5c11c1f2cd77220c7/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L85) of `10 ETH` which will force full liquidation for the next liquidation attempt. ( _There is a different bug which won't allow the next liquidation attempt but that is unrelated to the current issue_ ).
    - No attack vector here.

2. However `closeFactorMantissa` constraint is not applicable in a deprecated market. So Alice does this:
    - Liquidates `44 ETH` of debt.
    - Receives `12% * 44 = 5.28 ETH` of liquidation incentive.
    - Remaining debt = `45 - 44 = 1 ETH` and remaining collateral = `50 - 44 - 5.28 = 0.72 ETH`. 
    - New LTV = `100 * 1 / 0.72 = 138.89%`. 
    - We moved into `badDebt` territory. No incentive for liquidators now to liquidate this.

### Attack Vector 2 ( _leave behind unhealthy dust amount of debt_ )
**Setup:**
- Bob has borrowed 9 ETH worth against collateral of 11 ETH worth. 85% LTV is allowed.
- Liquidation incentive is 1%.
- Price movement causes Bob borrow to be worth `10.8890888899 ETH`, and collateral to be worth `10.998 ETH` making it eligible for liquidation by Alice.

1. Alice liquidates `10.8888889 ETH` worth of debt. She receives `10.8888889 * 1.01 = 10.997777789 ETH` worth of collateral.
2. Remaining debt = `10.998 - 10.8888889 = 0.000199989900000475 ETH` and remaining collateral = `10.998 - 10.997777789 = 0.000222211000000527 ETH`. 
3. New LTV = `100 * 0.000199989900000475 / 0.000222211000000527 = 90%`. 

The remaining collateral is just too low to be profitable after gas costs.

## Impact
In the end these unhealthy low value debts & bad debts will never get liquidated, worsening protocol health. The protocol's goal of clearing a deprecated market is also not achieved.

## Mitigation
Add these 2 checks:
1. If upon partial liquidation, leftover debt is in the `badDebt` territory, then it should revert and only allow full liquidation albeit with a reduced liquidation incentive.
2. If upon partial liquidation, leftover debt is less than `minLeftoverDebtAllowed` (some small value decided by the protocol) then it should revert.
