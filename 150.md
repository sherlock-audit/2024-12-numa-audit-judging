# LeverageStrategy() and closeLeverageStrategy() in CNuma contract will not work as intended due to potential corruption of ordering in `leverageStrategies`

### Summary

Both [LeverageStrategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L141) and [closeLeverageStrategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L243) in CNumaToken.sol do not sanitize the input `_strategyIndex` which is later used to fetch the strategy  from EnumerableSet called `leverageStrategies`. OZ EnumerableSet  provides [no guarantees](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4c3ef87cf57b448a0b5fc68b8ce6604a31b60814/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol#L16) that the
 order of elements is preserved and its remove function uses the [swap-and-pop](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/4c3ef87cf57b448a0b5fc68b8ce6604a31b60814/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSet.sol#L89-L91) method 
 which guarantees that order will be corrupted when a strategy is removed by the owner. The corrupted order of set may cause potantial risks explained below

### Root Cause

There is no check on  `_strategyIndex` in the following functions:
CNumaToken::LeverageStrategy() 
CNumaToken::closeLeverageStrategy()
which may create potential impacts for the user/protocol

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin calls removeStrategy():
```solidity
 function removeStrategy(address _strategy) external onlyAdmin {
        require(leverageStrategies.contains(_strategy), "not in list");
        leverageStrategies.remove(_strategy);//@ this will lead to a corrupted order of set
        emit RemovedStrategy(_strategy);
    }
```
and removes a leverage strategy. 

### External pre-conditions

Users make a call to one of the following functions:
CNumaToken::LeverageStrategy() 
CNumaToken::closeLeverageStrategy()


### Attack Path

There might different attack paths here. Here are 2 examples
Example 1: Letâ€™s say the `leverageStrategies `set contains three strategies:
Index 0: Strategy A
Index 1: Strategy B
Index 2: Strategy C

**Example 1:**
1. User calls `LeverageStrategy()` with strategyIndex = 1,
2. The admin removes strategy B by making a call to `removeStrategy()`
3. Now, since strategy B is removed, and the internal ordering of the set is changed so that Strategy C is placed at index 1, the next time user call leverageStrategy with strategyIndex = 1, s/he might end up selecting Strategy C instead of the original Strategy B.

**Example 2:**
1. User calls `LeverageStrategy()` with strategyIndex = 1,
2. The admin removes strategy B by making a call to `removeStrategy()`
3. User makes a call to `closeLeverageStrategy()` by passing strategyIndex = 1, This will lead to accessing the wrong Strategy. The`closeLeverageStrategy()` includes some other critical functions such as [vault.borrowLeverage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L285),  [strat.swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/lending/CNumaToken.sol#L314) ` and vault.repayLeverage`. If the strategy accessed by the index is invalid or incorrect  it may create different potential impacts with each one of these functions. For instance The `strat.swap()` function will  handle token conversions or collateral management incorrectly.
The borrow and repay functions also will be affected due  to invalid strategy, potentially leading to wrong amounts being borrowed or repaid, causing a breakdown in the protocol's leverage mechanism.


### Impact

There might be different impacts, Here are some potential risks:

- Accessing wrong strategy
- Incorrect repayment  of borrowed amount
- Flashloan failures or improper repayment: Since the protocol relies on flashloans, the system may not be able to calculate the correct amount to repay the flashloan, or the flashloan repayment could fail due to the wrong strategy being used to manage collateral.

### Mitigation

I can not suggest an easy fix. However make sure that the strategyIndex passed into relevant  functions mentioned above is 
1)not invalid or out-of-range 
2) pointing correctly the intended strategy
