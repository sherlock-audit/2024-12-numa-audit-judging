# Not accounting for buy fee in liquidateLstBorrow()

### Summary

Not accounting for buy fee when converting rETH to NUMA. This underestimates the user’s profit, and overestimates the `maxNumaProfitForLiquidations`

This allows the liquidator’s profit to greatly exceed the true max profit.

Affected code: [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1190-L1201)

### Root Cause

The following check is used to limit the liquidator’s NUMA profit in `liquidateLstBorrower()`:

```solidity
uint vaultProfit;
if (numaLiquidatorProfit > maxNumaProfitForLiquidations) {
    vaultProfit = numaLiquidatorProfit - maxNumaProfitForLiquidations;
}

uint numaToSend = receivedNuma - vaultProfit;
```

`numaLiquidatorProfit` is calculated via:

```solidity
uint numaLiquidatorProfit;
// we don't revert if liquidation is not profitable because it might be profitable
// by selling lst to numa using uniswap pool
if (receivedNuma > numaProvidedEstimate) {
    numaLiquidatorProfit = receivedNuma - numaProvidedEstimate; //@i estimate does not consider buyFee, so NUMA estimate is too high. 
}
```

It uses `numaProvidedEstimate` (since the liquidator provides LST), and is calculated via: 

```solidity
uint numaProvidedEstimate = vaultManager.tokenToNuma(
    lstAmount,
    last_lsttokenvalueWei,
    decimals,
    criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
);
```

This does not account for the buy fee which occurs when converting the LST to NUMA. This means that the estimate for the numa provided is too high. This causes the profit to be underestimated. This allows the true profit to exceed the maximum profit.

In addition to this, `maxNumaProfitForLiquidations` is calculated by converting the max LST profit to NUMA, but not accounting for the buy fee either, allowing the liquidator’s profit to be even higher.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Liquidation occurs where the liquidation bonus exceeds the max profit
2. Profit received exceeds the max allowed profit

### Impact

The actual liquidation profit received can exceed `maxNumaProfitForLiquidations` (which was already overestimated).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply the buy fee to both `numaProvidedEstimate` and `maxNumaProfitForLiquidations`
