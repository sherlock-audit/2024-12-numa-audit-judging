# Restricted access or functionality to getAmountIn

### Summary

Restricted access or functionality to getAmountIn due to requirement of msg.sender being a contract and not an EOA. This means msg.sender cannot call this function and only contracts can call this function which is not intended.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/NumaLeverageVaultSwap.sol#L17C5-L41C6

In the getAmountIn function, 
    function getAmountIn(
        uint256 _amount,
        bool _closePosition
    ) external view returns (uint256) {
        CNumaToken cNuma = vault.cNuma();
        CNumaToken cLstToken = vault.cLstToken();


        if (
            ((msg.sender == address(cLstToken)) && (!_closePosition)) ||
            ((msg.sender == address(cNuma)) && (_closePosition))
        ) {
            uint amountIn = vault.getBuyNumaAmountIn(_amount);
            amountIn = amountIn + (amountIn * slippage) / 1 ether;
            return amountIn;
        } else if (
            ((msg.sender == address(cNuma)) && (!_closePosition)) ||
            ((msg.sender == address(cLstToken)) && (_closePosition))
        ) {
            uint amountIn = vault.getSellNumaAmountIn(_amount);
            amountIn = amountIn + (amountIn * slippage) / 1 ether;
            return amountIn;
        } else {
            revert("not allowed");
        }
    }
The function uses msg.sender to determine the control flow in both getAmountIn and swap functions.

The conditions check if msg.sender is equal to the addresses of cNuma or cLstToken, which are contracts, not users.
Regular users cannot interact with these functions because their addresses will not match the contract addresses of cNuma or cLstToken. 
Relying on msg.sender being a specific contract is not secure, as contracts can be spoofed or proxies can change addresses.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This restricts functionality of the function. regular users won't be able to call it

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use access control libraries or patterns, such as OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl, to manage permissions. Define roles or permissions that specify which addresses (users or contracts) can call these functions.
