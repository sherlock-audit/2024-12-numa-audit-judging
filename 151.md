# lst vault profit is lost

### Summary

        if (_swapToInput) {
            // sell numa to lst
            uint lstReceived = NumaVault(address(this)).sell(
                receivedNuma,
                lstAmount,
                address(this)
            );


            uint lstLiquidatorProfit = lstReceived - lstAmount;


            // cap profit
            if (lstLiquidatorProfit > maxLstProfitForLiquidations)
                lstLiquidatorProfit = maxLstProfitForLiquidations;


            uint lstToSend = lstLiquidatorProfit;
            if (!_flashloan) {
                // send profit + input amount
                lstToSend += lstAmount;
            }
            // send profit
            SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(lstToken), msg.sender, lstToSend);


the function first sells received numa to obtain lst then it computes the liquidator profit after the sell and if the profit exceeds the maxlstprofitforliquidation the code caps the profit and transfers the lstToSend to the liquidator however the excess amount is not added or burned 

the same issue is present in liquidateNumaBorrower

### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

this can also be exploited by a liquidator
Since liquidate fails to call for an update to the excess tokens, there is a surplus which can be taken
the contracts balance will be higher, when another liquidator calls liquidation
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L1031
this will show a excess lst value because of leftover tokens during the last liquidation ,the code will redeem this token for the liquidator 

### Impact

if the excess profit was meant for the protocol it will be lost forever or if it was meant to be burned it will cause an accounting issue in the protocol or theft of tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

burn the excess tokens or add it to lst balance
