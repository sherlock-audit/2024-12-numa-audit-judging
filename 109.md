# Fee Deduction on NUMA Token Transfer Causes `liquidateNumaBorrower` and liquidation Failures.

### Summary

The `NumaVault` liquidation logic fails when transferring NUMA tokens from the liquidator/msg.sender to the contract due to a fee on NUMA tokens, which reduces the actual amount while transferring Numa tokens. The contract/NumaVault approves the cNUMA contract to use the entire transferred amount, but the actual tokens received are less than expected because of the fee. This mismatch leads to failed operations, such as liquidation or further transfers, since the contract does not have enough tokens to meet the required approval amount.

### Root Cause

NUMA tokens have a transfer fee mechanism that deducts a portion of the transferred amount as a fee during every transfer. However, the liquidation logic assumes the contract receives the full amount of NUMA tokens sent by the liquidator. This discrepancy creates a mismatch between:

1. The amount approved for `cNUMA` contract.
2. The actual tokens available in the contract post-transfer.
The liquidation process breaks as it tries to use an amount that is larger than what the contract holds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The NUMA token contract have set fee variable while token transfers .
2. The liquidator transfers NUMA tokens to the liquidation contract via SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom().
3. The liquidation logic approves the transferred amount for the `cNUMA` contract without accounting for the fee deduction.
4. The `cNUMA` contract attempts to use the approved amount for liquidation, but the actual tokens received are insufficient.

the attack will always DOS the liquidation because of insufficient amount of tokens in contract `Numa.sol` don't apply fee on whitelisted user, but the liquidation function can be called by anyone so every user cannot be a whitelisted user, second condition is Fee > 0 which we can assume will be more than 0 if they protocol have implemented the functionality.   

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A liquidator initiates a liquidation by transferring the required amount of NUMA tokens to the `NumaVault` contract.
2. Due to the NUMA token fee, the contract receives fewer tokens than the transferred amount.
3. The liquidation contract approves the full transferred amount (without adjusting for the fee) for the `cNUMA` contract which further uses the same amount(with fee deducted amount) for liquidation operation.
4. The `cNUMA` contract tries to utilize the approved amount during the liquidation process, but the `NumaVault` does not have enough  NUMA tokens to fulfil the operation.
5. The operation reverts, leaving the liquidation incomplete.

### Impact

Liquidation Failure: Borrower liquidations fail, potentially causing systemic risks in the protocol if under-collateralized positions are not resolved.

### PoC

## Example
1. Liquidator Try to Liquidate position NumaAmount = 1000 
2. Transfer the Numa tokens to NumaVault.sol 
3. Assume Fee = 2 % of transferred amount
4. Fee = 1000 * 20/ 100 = 20
5. Actual transferred tokens = 1000 - 20 = 980
6. but, vault approved 1000 tokens, and in `CER20` contract `doTransferIn` try to transfer 1000 tokens but vault doesn't have that much tokens
7. Result, Revert the transaction.    

### Mitigation

1. Calculate Received Tokens: Adjust the amount of NUMA tokens received by the liquidation contract after deducting the transfer fee.
2. Implement the before and after balance mechanism and check the current available amount in the contract, and have a variable the can check the received amount is not less than certain percentage otherwise revert the tx.
