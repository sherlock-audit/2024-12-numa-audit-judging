# Possible Incorrect `utilizationRate` function

### Summary

In the [utilizationRate()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/lending/JumpRateModelV4.sol#L108) function, cash and borrows and reserves values gets used to calculate utilization rate between between `[0, 1e18]`.

If Borrow value is 0, then function will return 0. but in this function the scenario where the value of reserves exceeds cash is not handled. the system does not guarantee that reserves never exceeds cash. the reserves grow automatically over time, so it might be difficult to avoid this entirely.

If reserves > cash (and borrows + cash - reserves > 0), the formula for utilizationRate above gives a utilization rate above 1.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `utilizationRate()` function can return a value above 1 and not between [0, 1e18].

### PoC

```solidity
function utilizationRate(
        uint cash,
        uint borrows,
        uint reserves
    ) public pure override returns (uint) {
        // Utilization rate is 0 when there are no borrows
        if (borrows == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return (borrows * 1e18) / (cash + borrows - reserves);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Make the utilization rate computation return 1 if reserves > cash.
