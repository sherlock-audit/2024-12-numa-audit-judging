# Fee removed whenNUMA is sold can be lost

### Summary

When NUMa is being sold, fees are deducted from the amount being sold provided the seller is not exemppted form paying fees

```solidity
File: NumaVault.sol
564:     function sell(
565:         uint256 _numaAmount,
566:         uint256 _minTokenAmount,
567:         address _receiver
568:     ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint _tokenOut) {

///     .............
594:   @>    if (feeWhitelisted[msg.sender]) {
595:             fee = 1 ether;
596:         }
597:    @>   _tokenOut = (tokenAmount * fee) / 1 ether;
598:         require(_tokenOut >= _minTokenAmount, "Min Token");

```

### Root Cause

The problem is that not all the fees deducted are accounted for in the protocol and such fees are entirely lost


```solidity

File: NumaVault.sol

597:   @>    _tokenOut = (tokenAmount * fee) / 1 ether;
598:         require(_tokenOut >= _minTokenAmount, "Min Token");

///    ..........

File: NumaVault.sol
614:         if (fee_address != address(0x0)) {
615:             // fee to be transfered is a percentage of buy/sell fee
616:             uint feeTransferNum = fees * (1 ether - fee);
617:             uint feeTransferDen = uint(BASE_1000) * 1 ether;
618:             uint256 feeAmount = (feeTransferNum * tokenAmount) / // @audit MED: stil 20% of actual fees
619:                 (feeTransferDen); // sent to fee address
620: 
621:             // clip sent fees
622:             uint256 feeAmountMax = (feesMaxAmountPct * tokenAmount) / BASE_1000;
623:             if (feeAmount > feeAmountMax) feeAmount = feeAmountMax;
624: 
625:             SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(lstToken), fee_address, feeAmount); // @audit the remaining 80% of the actual fee posrtion from L597 is gone
626: 
627:             if (isContract(fee_address) && isFeeReceiver) {
628:                 // we don't check result as contract might not implement the deposit function (if multi sig for example)
629:                 fee_address.call(
630:                     abi.encodeWithSignature(
631:                         "DepositFromVault(uint256)",
632:                         feeAmount
633:                     )
634:                 );
635:             }

```
`fees` = 20%
- on L616, only 20% of the deducted fees are calculated to be removed from the entire fee that was charged on L597 above
- on L622, provided this fee does not exceed the max fee amount, this fee (20% of the entire fee that was charged) is sent to the fee receiver,
- The remaining 80% of the fee is lost entirely in the process of selling NUMA
