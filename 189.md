# Debase Logic Issue in getSynthScaling Function

# Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/VaultManager.sol#L514-L525
The debase logic in the getSynthScaling() function could result in incorrect behavior when calculating the debase adjustment for the synthetic PID (Price Impact Debase) due to potential issues with the deltaDebase value and the time difference (blockTime - lastBlockTime). This could cause inaccurate scaling or updates to the synthetic PID, affecting fee calculations and protocol behavior.
# Vulnerability Details:
### Issue: The calculation of the ndebase value, which is (blockTime - lastBlockTime) * debaseValue / deltaDebase, might result in incorrect updates to syntheticsCurrentPID if deltaDebase is too large relative to the time difference (blockTime - lastBlockTime).
### Severity: High
If the debase calculation (ndebase) is wrong, it could significantly affect the scaling mechanism, causing the system to either debase too quickly or not debase enough.
### Likelihood: Medium to High
This issue is likely when deltaDebase is incorrectly set or when time differences between blocks are very small.
### Impact: High
Incorrect debase calculations could lead to excessive or insufficient scaling, which could break the entire protocolâ€™s economy, possibly causing debt accumulation or under-collateralization.
### Impact: If the time difference is small or deltaDebase is large, the calculated ndebase could be too small, leading to a failure to meaningfully update the PID, or potentially resetting it incorrectly.
### Risk: This can result in the protocol not debasing or rebasing properly, affecting the behavior of the protocol, user transactions, and could lead to incorrect fee scaling or price adjustments.
# Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity

uint ndebase = ((blockTime - lastBlockTime) * debaseValue) / deltaDebase;
if (ndebase <= 0) {
    blockTime = lastBlockTime;
} else {
    if (syntheticsCurrentPID > ndebase) {
        syntheticsCurrentPID = syntheticsCurrentPID - ndebase;
        if (syntheticsCurrentPID < minimumScale)
            syntheticsCurrentPID = minimumScale;
    } else syntheticsCurrentPID = minimumScale;
}
```
If deltaDebase is large or the time difference (blockTime - lastBlockTime) is small, ndebase could end up too small or zero, leading to improper updates of syntheticsCurrentPID.
# Recommendations:
Bounds Check: Ensure that both blockTime - lastBlockTime and deltaDebase are within reasonable ranges to prevent the calculation of ndebase from becoming too small or zero.
Minimum Adjustment: Add a check to ensure that ndebase has a minimum value that makes meaningful adjustments to the PID.
Time Difference: Verify that time differences (blockTime - lastBlockTime) are significant enough to warrant a meaningful adjustment to the PID and scaling.
