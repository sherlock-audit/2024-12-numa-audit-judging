# Health calculation uses formulas that take fees into account.

### Summary

## Summary
Users' health calculation uses conversion formulas that apply fees, undermining borrower's health.
## Description
`getAccountLiquidityIsolateInternal` is used to determine how healthy a position is by checking for shortfall and bad debt. The price of the collateral is fetched here
```solidity
        // Get the normalized price of the asset
        vars.oraclePriceMantissaCollateral = oracle
            .getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral(collateral); 
```
If Numa is used as collateral, the price will be fetched by invoking `vault.numaToLst`
```solidity
    function getUnderlyingPriceAsCollateral(
        CNumaToken cToken
    ) public view override returns (uint) {
        INumaVault vault = cToken.vault();
        require((address(vault) != address(0)), "no vault");


        if (address(cToken) == vault.getcNumaAddress()) {
            // numa price from vault
            return vault.numaToLst(1e18);
        }
    }
```
However, `numaToLst` returns an output price which has sell fee subtracted

```solidity
    function numaToLst(uint256 _amount) external view returns (uint256) {
        (, , uint criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee, ) = vaultManager
            .getSynthScaling();

        uint256 refValue = last_lsttokenvalueWei;
        (uint256 rwd, uint256 currentvalueWei, ) = rewardsValue();
        if (rwd > rwd_threshold) {
            refValue = currentvalueWei;
        }

        uint256 tokenAmount = vaultManager.numaToToken(
            _amount,
            refValue,
            decimals,
            criticalScaleForNumaPriceAndSellFee
        );

        (uint sellFee, , ) = vaultManager.getSellFeeScaling();
        return (tokenAmount * sellFee) / 1 ether; // @audit-issue health factor calculation is deducted sell fee
    }
```
As a result, the returned price will be lower than the actual one, effectivelly undermining user health and potentially leading to unfair/unexpected liquidations despite sufficient collaterization. The sell fee should not be taken into the calculations since no conversion takes place while calculating borrower's health.

### Root Cause

- Collateral health calculation uses a formula that takes into consideration fees, fetched from [`NumaVault.numaToLst`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaVault.sol#L730-L731) 

### Internal pre-conditions

none 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

- Liquidator sees borrow who is on the verge of having shortfall / bad debt
- Liquidator initiates liquidation, knowing that collateral health calculation would report smaller value due to applying fees
- Borrower is unfairly liquidated

### Impact

- broken core functionality
- loss of funds for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't calculate borrower's health with formulas that apply fees.
