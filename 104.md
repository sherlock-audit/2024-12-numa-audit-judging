# CToken inflation attack

### Summary

Compound V2 empty markets are vulnerable to a vault inflation attack. The first depositor's funds can easily be stolen by donating a small amount to the market, artificially inflating the exchange rate, and then withdrawing after the victim's deposit. This attack can be repeated multiple times until a legitimate deposit is made.

### Root Cause

How the exchange rate is calculated when minting/redeeming cTokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin adding a new market.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin adds a new market
2. Attacker mints 1 wei worth of cTokens
3. Attacker donates some amount of underlying tokens directly to cToken via ERC20 transfer
4. Attacker waits for users deposits, due to round down user will get 0 cTokens
5. Attacker withdraws its cTokens, effectively stealing the users deposit

### Impact

Malicous users could steal the assets of the victim.

### PoC

No need

### Mitigation

Ensuring that there is always a minimum number of shares to guard against inflation attack is to mint a certain amount of shares to zero address (dead address) during contract deployment (similar to what has been implemented in Uniswap V2).
