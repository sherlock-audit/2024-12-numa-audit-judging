# Collision will cause wrong storage

### Vulnerability Detail

The in-scope `Unitroller` contract acts similar as a proxy - it holds the storage for the comptroller but delegates to it for the functionality:
```solidity
* @dev Storage for the comptroller is at this address, while execution is delegated to the `comptrollerImplementation`.
 * CTokens should reference this contract as their comptroller.
 */
contract Unitroller ... {
    ...
}
```
The issue is that their storage slots are not compatible. The first storage slots of the comptroller are based on the inherited `ComptrollerV7Storage`:
```solidity
contract NumaComptroller is ComptrollerV7Storage, ....
```
If we take a look at `Unitroller`, we will see the following:
```solidity
contract Unitroller is UnitrollerAdminStorage, ComptrollerErrorReporter {
```
### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Storage will be completely wrong causing all kinds of issues

### Mitigation

Make the storages between the contracts compatible
