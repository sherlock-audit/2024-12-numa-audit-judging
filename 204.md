# New markets are vulnerable to inflation attack

### Summary

New  markets are vulnerable to inflation attacks allowing an attacker to make profit from subsequent depositors.



### Root Cause

Ths exists in the exchange rate calculation in CToken.sol and CNumaLst.sol when new markets are created

Attacker canextract majority of user deposits through exchange rate manipulation in new markets



### Internal pre-conditions

new market needs to be added
initialExchangeRateMantissa = 1e18

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

example of this attacker sees new market in the mempool and the victims 10reth transaction so attacker frontruns this and 
Initial Market:
totalSupply = 0
initialExchangeRateMantissa = 1e18
Attacker Mints (1 wei rETH):
mintTokens = 1 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 1 wei cTokens
totalSupply = 1 wei
Direct Transfer10 reth
totalCash = 10e18 + 1 wei
Victim Mints (10 rETH):
mintTokens = 10e18 * 1e18 / 10e36 = 0 cTokens (rounds down)
totalSupply remains = 1 wei
totalCash = 20e18 + 1 wei
Attacker Redeems (1 wei cToken):
exchangeRate = (20e18 + 1) * 1e18 / 1 = ~20e36
redeemAmount = 1 * 20e36 / 1e18 = 20e18 rETH
Final Result:
Attacker input: 1 wei + 10 rETH
Attacker output: 20 rETH
Victim input: 10 rETH
Victim output: 0 cTokens
 profit: 10 reth

### Impact

Attacker can extract majority of user deposit funds through exchange rate manipulation by frontrunning in new market
