# `OracleUtils.ethToToken()` handles decimals incorrectly

### Vulnerability Detail

We have the following function:
```solidity
    function ethToToken(uint256 _ethAmount, address _pricefeed, uint128 _chainlink_heartbeat, uint256 _decimals) public view checkSequencerActive returns (uint256 tokenAmount) {
        ...
        tokenAmount = FullMath.mulDiv(_ethAmount, uint256(price), 10 ** AggregatorV3Interface(_pricefeed).decimals());
        ...
        tokenAmount = tokenAmount * 10 ** (18 - _decimals);
    }
```
The `_decimals` are the decimals of the token, aiming to convert `tokenAmount` into token decimals. This is incorrect as we should be dividing here in order to turn the 18 decimal ETH amount into token amount.
### Attack Path

1. User swaps 1e18 ETH to USDC at 3000e8 price and 8 price feed decimals
2. The `tokenAmount` equals $1e18 * 3000e8 / 1e8 = 3000e18$
3. After the decimal conversion, we turn it into 3000e30 instead of 3000e6
### Impact

Incorrect decimal conversion. As the protocol have clearly made it a priority to handle assets with a different amount of decimals, this is a serious and valid issue.
### Mitigation

Divide instead of multiply
