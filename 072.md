# Reentrancy Risk in NumaMinter's mint Function

### Summary

**The lack of reentrancy protection in NumaMinter.sol will cause potential fund loss for users as malicious actors can reenter the mint function through the external call.**


### Root Cause

In `NumaMinter.sol:31` the `mint` function makes an external call to another contract without implementing reentrancy protection and following the CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaMinter.sol#L35-L43

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must have minting permissions on the Numa token
2. Caller needs to be in the `allowedMinters` mapping
3. `numa` token address must be set to a non-zero address

### External pre-conditions

1. The Numa token contract must be controlled by a malicious actor or have a vulnerability that allows reentrancy

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker deploys a malicious token contract implementing INuma interface**
2. **Owner calls `setTokenAddress()` with the malicious token address**
3. **Attacker (who is an allowed minter) calls `mint()`**
4. **During the external call to `numa.mint()`, the malicious contract calls back into NumaMinter's `mint()` function**
5. **The cycle repeats until gas is exhausted or other limits are hit**


### Impact

The protocol suffers from uncontrolled minting of tokens. The attacker gains an excessive amount of tokens through repeated minting operations before any limits can be enforced.


### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousNuma is INuma {
    NumaMinter public minter;
    uint256 public count;
    constructor(address minter) {
        minter = NumaMinter(minter);
    }
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external override {
        if (count < 5) {
            // Prevent infinite loop in test
            count++;
            minter.mint(to, amount); // Reenter mint function
        }
    }
    // ... other required interface implementations
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Add ReentrancyGuard from OpenZeppelin.
```solidity
contract NumaMinter is Ownable2Step, ReentrancyGuard {
    function mint(
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external nonReentrant onlyMinters {
        require(address(numa) != address(0), "token address invalid");
        numa.mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

3. Consider implementing additional checks and balances such as minting limits per transaction or time-based restrictions.
