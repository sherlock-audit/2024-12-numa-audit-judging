# Malicious admin can set _setPriceOracle() with 0 address in NumaComptroller

### Summary

In `NumaComptroller.sol`, a malicious admin can set `_setPriceOracle()` with `newOracle` that has a 0 address.

### Root Cause

In `NumaComptroller.sol`, the function `_setPriceOracle()` does not revert if `newOracle` has a 0 address.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A.

### External pre-conditions

N/A.

### Attack Path

A malicious admin calls `NumaComptroller.sol` `_setPriceOracle()` with `newOracle` that has a 0 address.

### Impact

In `NumaComptroller.sol`, the function that relies on `oracle` such as `borrowAllowed()` also does not check whether `oracle` has the 0 address and assumes that it doesn't. This will cause these functions not to work as expected.

### PoC

Please place this `NumaComptroller_setPriceOracle.sol` in `contracts/Test`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.20;

import "./utils/SetupBase.sol";

import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";
import {NumaOracle} from "../NumaProtocol/NumaOracle.sol";

contract NumaComptroller_setPriceOracle is SetupBase {

    function setUp() public virtual {

        _setUpTokens();

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        comptroller = new NumaComptroller();

        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_setPriceOracle() public {

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        console.log(" initial address(comptroller.oracle()) = ", address(comptroller.oracle()));

        comptroller._setPriceOracle(comptroller.oracle());

        console.log(" after address(comptroller.oracle()) = ", address(comptroller.oracle()));

        assertEq(address(comptroller.oracle()), address(0x0));

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

Test with:
```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=lite forge test -vvv contracts/Test/NumaComptroller_setPriceOracle.t.sol
```

Sample output:
```bash
[PASS] test_setPriceOracle() (gas: 27994)
Logs:
   initial address(comptroller.oracle()) =  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
   after address(comptroller.oracle()) =  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

Ran 1 test suite in 12.25ms (3.25ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

### Mitigation

In `NumaComptroller.sol`, modify `_setPriceOracle()`  so that it checks whether  `newOracle` has a 0 address.
