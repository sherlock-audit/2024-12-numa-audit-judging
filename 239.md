# User spends more Numa tokens than required to mint an amount of nuAsset tokens

### Summary

Higher Price between vault buy price and LP price is Used to Mint nuAsset from Numa, instead of using the lower price.


### Root Cause

In [NumaPrinter.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L407), a wrong calculation is done to get the lowest price between Vault buy price and LP Price, and this results in the higher price used to mint a nuAsset from Numa. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `mintAssetOutputFromNuma` when `vault buy price != LP Price`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

 1. User  calls `mintAssetOutputFromNuma` when `vault buy price != LP Price`
2. `getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee`is called to fetch the min amount of Numa needed to mint ` _nuAssetAmount`
3.  Higher amount between vault buy price `numaAmountVault` and LP price `numaAmountPrice` is returned 

### Impact

The user spends more numa token than required, to mint the commensurate amount of nuAsset tokens.

### Mitigation

[The line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/ae1d7781efb4cb2c3a40c642887ddadeecabb97d/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L407)

```solidity 
if (numaAmountVault >  NumaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = NumaAmountVault 
```

should be changed to

```solidity
if (numaAmountVault <  NumaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = NumaAmountVault 
```
