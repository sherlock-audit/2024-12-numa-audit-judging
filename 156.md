# Wrong price used in the minting and burning of synths will result in loss to the user.

### Root Cause

To protect the integrity of NUMA protocol, the minting and burning of synths is based on the formula provided in the whitepaper [Details can be found here](https://numa-1.gitbook.io/numa-v3-white-paper/mechanics/numoney-synthetics#mint-and-burn-price-calculations).

However, looking into [`NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L381C5-L415C6) and [`NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/main/Numa/contracts/NumaProtocol/NumaPrinter.sol#L424C5-L460C6), when the lowest of the 15mins LP price, 30mins LP price and the LP spot price, and the vault price is compared, the max is taken in getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee() when the comment right above and the whitepaper states otherwise (in this function, we are minting, therefore we apply the mint price formula). As for getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee(), the reverse is the case. We use the minimum price after the comparison when we ought to use the maximum price. 

```solidity
NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee()
function getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _nuAssetAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        .................................

        // mint price is the minimum between vault buy price and LP price
        uint costWithoutFee = numaAmountPool;
        if (numaAmountVault > numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
        .................................
}
```

```solidity
NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee()
function getNbOfNumaFromAssetWithFee(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _nuAssetAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        .................................

       // burn price is the max between vault sell price and LP price
        uint costWithoutFee = numaAmountPool;

        if (numaAmountVault < numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
        .................................
}
```


We are essentially applying the wrong price during the minting and burning of synthetics

### Impact

The most fundamental impact of this vulnerability applies to arbitrage. Users who want to mint synths on LP to sell at a higher price will be unable to do so, as the tokens will be burnt at the lower of the prices and vice versa. Since arbitrage is one of the ways the protocol gets users to participate, this is detrimental to them as well. It will have a ripple effect, which will affect price and price peggings, the over-collateralization of the protocol, etc.

### Mitigation

```diff
NumaPrinter::getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee()
function getNbOfNumaNeededAndFee(
        address _nuAsset,
        uint256 _nuAssetAmount
    ) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        .................................

        // mint price is the minimum between vault buy price and LP price
        uint costWithoutFee = numaAmountPool;
-      if (numaAmountVault > numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
+      if (numaAmountVault < numaAmountPool) costWithoutFee = numaAmountVault;
        .................................
}
```

```diff

        .................................

       // burn price is the max between vault sell price and LP price
        uint costWithoutFee = numaAmountPool;
