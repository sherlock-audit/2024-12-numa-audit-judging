# Attacker can steal funds of depositor due to inflation attack

### Summary

When depositor deposit token in the contract he will get cToken against it according to the exchange rate.
```solidity
function mint(uint mintAmount) external override returns (uint) {
    mintInternal(mintAmount);
    return NO_ERROR;
}
```
It calculates exchange rate from the `exchangeRateStoredInternal` function:
```solidity
function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
        } else {
            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;
            return exchangeRate;
        }
    }
```
Here, when `totalSupply` is 0 the exchange rate will be `initialExchangeRateMantissa` and not burning any shares to dead address at the time of first deposit in the vault.

For calculation of `totalCash`, it calls `getCashPrior` function and this function simply get token balance with balance of address this. Due to which attacker can manipulate easily by donating tokens to the contract.

```solidity
function getCashPrior() internal view virtual override returns (uint) {
        EIP20Interface token = EIP20Interface(underlying);
        return token.balanceOf(address(this));
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Total supply must be 0 and attacker have to be the first depositor.

### Attack Path

- Attacker deposit 1 wei with `mint` function and get 1 wei shares when total supply is 0.
- UserA wants to deposit 100e18 asset with `mint` function.
- Attacker will see the transaction in the mempool and donate 1000e18 in the contract to inflate total asset.
- After that userA transaction executes and userA will get 0 shares due to inflated total asset.
- Now attacker claims 1 share and get all the asset back (1000e18 + 100e18 + 1 wei).
- Therefore userA suffer loss of his asstes (100e18).

### Impact

Loss of funds for the depositor to whom attacker front-run.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Protocol should make sure that some shares should be send to dead address while first deposit like uniswapV2.
