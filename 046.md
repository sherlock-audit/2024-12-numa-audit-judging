# Lack of Access Control

### Summary

Functions like `deploy_NumaV2` and `migrate_NumaV1V2` can be called by any address, which creates security risks and may lead to unauthorized deployments or migrations.


### Root Cause

In `vaultV2Deployer.sol`, there are no access control mechanisms implemented for critical functions, allowing anyone to execute them.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin should be the only one able to call `deploy_NumaV2` and `migrate_NumaV1V2`.


### External pre-conditions

1. No external pre-conditions are required, but an unauthorized user could potentially call the functions.


### Attack Path

1. An unauthorized user calls `deploy_NumaV2()` or `migrate_NumaV1V2()`.
2. The contract executes the function without restriction, potentially causing unwanted deployments or migrations.

### Impact

The protocol may experience unwanted contract deployments or migrations, potentially leading to erroneous contract states or security vulnerabilities.


### PoC

[Numa/contracts/deployment/vaultV2Deployer.sol](https://github.com/arpitverma123/2024-12-numa-audit/blob/974d328f5cbe6a76e78f7d63ec6f8835155743f6/Numa/contracts/deployment/vaultV2Deployer.sol#L52)
```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
    _;
}

function deploy_NumaV2() public onlyOwner {
    // deployment logic
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement access control mechanisms like `onlyOwner` modifier for critical functions to ensure that only authorized users can call them.
