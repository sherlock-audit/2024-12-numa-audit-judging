# Vault inflation causing victims to lose their full deposit

### Summary

A vault inflation attack is possible that causes victims to lose their full deposit, while the attacker loses nothing.


### Root Cause

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Attacker should be the first depositor.
Total Supply of LP token should be Zero

### Attack Path

- When total supply is zero an attacker goes ahead and executes the following steps :
    - Mint 1 wei of share by depositing 1 wei of underlying asset through `mint()`
    ```solidity
    function mint(uint mintAmount) external override returns (uint) {
        mintInternal(mintAmount);
        return NO_ERROR;
    }
    ```
    - Afterwards the attacker would wait for user who wants to deposit some number of assets.
    - Let's suppose Bob wants to deposit 10e18 underlying asset.
    - Now attacker would see the transaction in mempool and frontrun the Bob's transaction and donates 100e18 underlying assets to contract thus inflating the total assets in contract.
    - Now when Bob's transaction gets executed he would be minted 0 shares in against of providing 10e18 due to inflation of shares in contract so a total loss of 10e18 to user.
    - After that attacker claims his 1 share worth of 110e18 + 1 of underlying assets.
    - The main problem occurs while calculating ExchangeRate
    ```solidity
    function exchangeRateStoredInternal() internal view virtual returns (uint) {
        uint _totalSupply = totalSupply;
        if (_totalSupply == 0) {
            /*
             * If there are no tokens minted:
             *  exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate
             */
            return initialExchangeRateMantissa;
        } else {
            /*
             * Otherwise:
             *  exchangeRate = (totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalSupply
             */
            uint totalCash = getCashPrior();
            uint cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves = totalCash +
                totalBorrows -
                totalReserves;
            uint exchangeRate = (cashPlusBorrowsMinusReserves * expScale) /
                _totalSupply;

            return exchangeRate;
        }
    }
    ```
    - As during calculation of Exchange Rate totalCash is being calculated through balanceOf(address(this)) which can be easily donated by attacker and manipulate share price.
    - Due to this attacker can inflate the share price by donating.

### Impact

Victims lose their funds

_No response_

### Mitigation

I like how BalancerV2 and UniswapV2 do it. some MINIMUM amount of shares get burnt when the first mint happens.
